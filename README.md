# Simplify your llm testing experience

## Idea

Almost for every dataset, you have to write your own script to test it. This project aims to simplify that process by providing a unified framework for testing various datasets with minimal configuration.

## Usage

You can create your own test suite for your own dataset by taking MME_TestModel as an example.
