Therefore, DB = DC.\n   - The angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. This means \u2220BAC = \u2220ACE = 25\u00b0.\n\n3. **Use the properties of the circle:**\n   - Since AB is the diameter, \u2220ACB = 90\u00b0 (angle in a semicircle).\n\n4. **Calculate the angles in triangle ABC:**\n   - \u2220BAC = 25\u00b0 (given).\n   - \u2220ACB = 90\u00b0 (angle in a semicircle).\n   - Therefore, \u2220ABC = 180\u00b0 - \u2220BAC - \u2220ACB = 180\u00b0 - 25\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 = 65\u00b0.\n\n5. **Determine the angle \u2220D:**\n   - Since DB and DC are tangents from the same external point D, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = DC.\n   - Therefore, \u2220DBC = \u2220DCB.\n   - The sum of angles in triangle DBC is 180\u00b0.\n   - Let \u2220DBC = \u2220DCB = x.\n   - Then, x + x + \u2220BDC = 180\u00b0.\n   - Since \u2220BDC = \u2220ABC = 65\u00b0 (alternate segment theorem), we have:\n     2x + 65\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n   - Solving for x, we get:\n     2x = 180\u00b0 - 65\u00b0 = 115\u00b0.\n     x = 115\u00b0 / 2 = 57.5\u00b0.\n\n6. **Calculate \u2220D:**\n   - \u2220D = \u2220DBC + \u2220DCB = x + x = 2x = 2 * 57.5\u00b0 = 115\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this calculation seems incorrect based on the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem:\n\n- Since \u2220ABC = 65\u00b0 and \u2220BAC = 25\u00b0, the angle \u2220D is actually the external angle for triangle ABC at vertex B.\n- The external angle is equal to the sum of the opposite internal angles.\n- Therefore, \u2220D = \u2220BAC + \u2220ACB = 25\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 115\u00b0.\n\nThis calculation still does not match the given choices. The correct approach should be:\n\n- \u2220D is the angle formed by the tangents DB and DC.\n- Since DB and DC are tangents from the same point, \u2220D is actually the angle subtended by the arc BC at the point D.\n- The angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended by it at any point on the alternate segment.\n- Therefore, \u2220D = 2 * \u2220BAC = 2 * 25\u00b0 = 50\u00b0.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 50\u00b0", "expectedOutput": "50\u00b0", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output correctly identifies the answer as (A) 50\u00b0, which matches the expected output of 50\u00b0.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 10.786290874995757, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 227}, {"name": "test_case_223", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is this a periodic function?\nChoices:\n(A) Yes\n(B) No", "actualOutput": "This is not a periodic function.

The net rate of change of salt in the tank is the rate of salt entering minus the rate of salt leaving.\n   - This gives us the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{1}{4}r - \\frac{Q(t)}{100}r\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the differential equation:**\n   - Factor out \\( r \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dQ}{dt} = r \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{Q(t)}{100} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplify further:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dQ}{dt} = r \\left( \\frac{25 - Q(t)}{100} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve the differential equation\n\n1. **Separate variables and integrate:**\n   - Rewrite the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dQ}{25 - Q(t)} = \\frac{r}{100} dt\n     \\]\n   - Integrate both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\int \\frac{1}{25 - Q(t)} dQ = \\int \\frac{r}{100} dt\n     \\]\n   - The left side integrates to:\n     \\[\n     -\\ln|25 - Q(t)| = \\frac{r}{100} t + C\n     \\]\n   - Exponentiate both sides to solve for \\( Q(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     25 - Q(t) = e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t + C} = e^C e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( e^C = K \\):\n     \\[\n     25 - Q(t) = K e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( Q(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     Q(t) = 25 - K e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the constant \\( K \\) using the initial condition:**\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( Q(0) = Q_0 \\):\n     \\[\n     Q_0 = 25 - K\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     K = 25 - Q_0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\( K \\) back into the equation:**\n   - The solution is:\n     \\[\n     Q(t) = 25 - (25 - Q_0) e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the limiting amount \\( Q_L \\)\n\n1. **As \\( t \\to \\infty \\), \\( e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t} \\to 0 \\):**\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     Q_L = 25\n     \\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the time \\( T \\) when the salt level is within 2% of \\( Q_L \\)\n\n1. **Given \\( Q_0 = 2 Q_L \\):**\n   - \\( Q_0 = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\)\n\n2. **Set up the condition for \\( Q(t) \\) to be within 2% of \\( Q_L \\):**\n   - \\( Q(t) \\) should be within 2% of 25:\n     \\[\n     25 - 0.02 \\times 25 = 25 - 0.5 = 24.5\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     Q(t) = 24.5\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\( Q(t) = 24.5 \\) into the solution:**\n   - \\( 24.5 = 25 - (25 - 50) e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t} \\)\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     24.5 = 25 - 25 e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t} \\):\n     \\[\n     0.5 = 25 e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 25:\n     \\[\n     0.02 = e^{-\\frac{r}{100} t}\n     \\]\n   - Take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n     \\[\n     \\ln(0.02) = -\\frac{r}{100} t\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     t = -\\frac{100}{r} \\ln(0.02)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( r = 3 \\):**\n   - \\( t = -\\frac{100}{3} \\ln(0.02) \\)\n   - Calculate the value:\n     \\[\n     t \\approx -\\frac{100}{3} \\times (-3.912) \\approx 130.4\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the time \\( T \\) after which the salt level is within 2% of \\( Q_L \\) is approximately \\( 130.4 \\) minutes.", "expectedOutput": "130.4", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output of 130.4 minutes.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 22.51050979201682, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 352}, {"name": "test_case_373", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: What is the sum of the accuracies of the algorithms calf and ivory?", "actualOutput": "The sum of the accuracies of the algorithms calf and ivory is 13.", "expectedOutput": "13", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output, providing the correct sum of 13.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 21.19369979100884, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 373}, {"name": "test_case_355", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Are there fewer big motorbikes than rubber choppers?\nChoices:\n(A) Yes\n(B) No", "actualOutput": "To determine if there are fewer big motorbikes than rubber choppers, let's analyze the image:\n\n1. **Big Motorbikes**: There is one large red motorbike in the image.\n2. **Rubber Choppers**: There are no rubber choppers visible in the image.\n\nSince there is one big motorbike and no rubber choppers, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Yes", "expectedOutput": "No", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output (A) Yes does not match the expected output (No).", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 22.6930203330121, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 355}, {"name": "test_case_376", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is Orange Red the high median?\nChoices:\n(A) yes\n(B) no", "actualOutput": "To determine if Orange Red is the high median, we need to find the median value of the data set.

In such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2. Therefore, if BC = 2.0, then AC = 2\u221a3 and AB = 4.0.\n\nThe circle \u2299C is tangent to the hypotenuse AB at point P. The line segment PQ is a tangent to the circle at point Q. The length of the tangent from a point outside a circle to the point of tangency is the same for all tangents from that point. Therefore, the minimum value of PQ will occur when P is the point on AB that is closest to the circle.\n\nThe closest point on AB to the circle will be the point where the perpendicular from C to AB intersects AB. This point is the foot of the altitude from C to AB. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into segments that are in the ratio 1:2. Therefore, the length of the segment from A to the foot of the altitude is 2.0 (half of AB), and the length of the segment from B to the foot of the altitude is 2.0.\n\nThe length of the altitude (which is also the length of the line segment from C to the foot of the altitude) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the length of the altitude h. Then:\n\nh^2 + 1^2 = (2\u221a3)^2\nh^2 + 1 = 12\nh^2 = 11\nh = \u221a11\n\nThe length of the line segment PQ is the length of the altitude minus the radius of the circle. Therefore:\n\nPQ = h - 1\nPQ = \u221a11 - 1\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. The correct approach to find the minimum value of PQ is to consider the properties of the tangent and the circle. The minimum value of PQ will occur when P is the point on AB that is closest to the circle, which is the point where the perpendicular from C to AB intersects AB. This point is the foot of the altitude from C to AB.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into segments that are in the ratio 1:2. Therefore, the length of the segment from A to the foot of the altitude is 2.0 (half of AB), and the length of the segment from B to the foot of the altitude is 2.0.\n\nThe length of the altitude (which is also the length of the line segment from C to the foot of the altitude) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the length of the altitude h. Then:\n\nh^2 + 1^2 = (2\u221a3)^2\nh^2 + 1 = 12\nh^2 = 11\nh = \u221a11\n\nHowever, this calculation is not necessary to find the minimum value of PQ. The minimum value of PQ will occur when P is the point on AB that is closest to the circle, which is the point where the perpendicular from C to AB intersects AB. This point is the foot of the altitude from C to AB.\n\nIn a 30-60-90 triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse divides the hypotenuse into segments that are in the ratio 1:2. Therefore, the length of the segment from A to the foot of the altitude is 2.0 (half of AB), and the length of the segment from B to the foot of the altitude is 2.0.\n\nThe length of the altitude (which is also the length of the line segment from C to the foot of the altitude) is \u221a3 (since the altitude in a 30-60-90 triangle is \u221a3 times the shorter leg, which is 1.0 in this case).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of PQ is the length of the altitude minus the radius of the circle:\n\nPQ = \u221a3 - 1\n\nThis is not one of the given options, but it is the correct answer.
