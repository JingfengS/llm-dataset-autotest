Given this data, what is the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase?\nChoices:\n(A) 0\n(B) 700\n(C) 1400\n(D) 3418", "actualOutput": "To determine the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase when someone deposits $700 at TD Bank, we need to consider the reserve requirement ratio. The reserve requirement ratio is the fraction of deposits that a bank must hold in reserve and not lend out.\n\nFrom the balance sheet, we can see that TD Bank has reserves of $493 and deposits of $2900. The reserve ratio can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Reserve Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Reserves}}{\\text{Deposits}} = \\frac{493}{2900} \\approx 0.17 \\]\n\nThis means that the bank is required to keep approximately 17% of its deposits as reserves.\n\nWhen a new deposit of $700 is made, the bank must keep 17% of this deposit as reserves and can lend out the remaining 83%. The amount that the bank can lend out is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Lendable Amount} = 700 \\times (1 - 0.17) = 700 \\times 0.83 = 581 \\]\n\nThe money supply increases by the amount that the bank can lend out, which is $581. However, this is not the final increase in the money supply because the money that is lent out will eventually be deposited in the banking system again, and the process will repeat.\n\nTo find the total increase in the money supply, we use the money multiplier formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Money Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Reserve Ratio}} = \\frac{1}{0.17} \\approx 5.88 \\]\n\nThe total increase in the money supply is then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Increase} = \\text{Initial Deposit} \\times \\text{Money Multiplier} = 700 \\times 5.88 \\approx 4116 \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimum amount by which the money supply will increase, which is the amount that the bank can immediately lend out, $581. This is not one of the provided choices, so we need to consider the closest option.\n\nThe closest option to $581 is $700, which is the initial deposit.
