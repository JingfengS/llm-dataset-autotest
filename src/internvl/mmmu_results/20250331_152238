Colorblindness is typically an X-linked recessive trait. This means:\n\n1. Males (XY) have only one X chromosome, so if they inherit the colorblindness gene, they will express the trait.\n2. Females (XX) need to inherit two copies of the colorblindness gene (one from each parent) to express the trait. If they inherit only one copy, they will be carriers but not express the trait.\n\nLet's analyze the pedigree:\n\n- Individual 2 is a male and is affected (black square).\n- Individual 1 is a female and is a carrier (half-filled circle).\n- Their offspring include:\n  - Individual 3 (male, affected)\n  - Individual 4 (female, carrier)\n  - Individual 5 (female, normal)\n  - Individual 6 (male, affected)\n  - Individual 7 (male, normal)\n  - Individual 8 (female, carrier)\n  - Individual 9 (male, normal)\n\nGiven the pattern:\n- Affected males (Individuals 2, 3, and 6) are consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance.\n- Carrier females (Individuals 1, 4, and 8) are also consistent with this pattern.\n- Normal individuals (Individuals 5, 7, and 9) do not express the trait, which is expected.\n\nTherefore, the pedigree is consistent with the transmission pattern of colorblindness.\n\nAnswer: (A) True", "expectedOutput": "B", "context": ["Biochemistry and Genetics"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output choice 'A' does not match the expected output choice 'B'.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.9549405830039177, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 21}, {"name": "test_case_22", "input": "Question: <image 1>Which cell type is pictured?\nChoices:\n(A) Eosinophil\n(B) Thrombocyte\n(C) Lymphocyte\n(D) Monocyte\n(E) Neutrophil", "actualOutput": "The cell type pictured is (E) Neutrophil.", "expectedOutput": "E", "context": ["Cellular Physiology"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The choice made in actual_output (E) matches the choice in expected_output (E).", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.7705704159961897, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 22}, {"name": "test_case_23", "input": "Question: <image 1>In the diagram below, the P wave represents ___________, the QRS segment represents ___________ and the T wave represents _____________.\nChoices:\n(A) atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, ventricular repolarization\n(B) ventricular repolarization, atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization\n(C) ventricular depolarization, ventricular repolarization, atrial depolarization", "actualOutput": "r", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Cardiovascular Physiology"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The choice made in actual_output ('r') does not match the choice in expected_output ('A').", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.749297124995792, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 23}, {"name": "test_case_25", "input": "Question: <image 1>What kind of cell is this?\nChoices:\n(A) plant\n(B) animal\n(C) bacteria", "actualOutput": "r", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Cellular Physiology"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The choice made in actual_output ('r') does not match the choice in expected_output ('A').", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "internvl2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.511725042000762, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 25}, {"name": "test_case_24", "input": "Question: Where do the axons of this nucleus terminate?
