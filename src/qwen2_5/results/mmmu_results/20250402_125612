This also increases the bank's assets (Reserves) by $700, assuming no immediate lending occurs.\n\nThe updated balance sheet after the deposit is:\n\n| **Assets**       | **Liabilities**     |\n|------------------|---------------------|\n| Reserves: 493 + 700 = 1193 | Deposits: 2900 + 700 = 3600 |\n| Loans: 2407      |                     |\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Reserve Requirement\nThe reserve requirement is the fraction of deposits that the bank must hold as reserves. Let's denote the reserve requirement ratio as \\( r \\). The reserve requirement for the new deposits is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Required Reserves} = r \\times \\text{New Deposits}\n\\]\n\nThe bank can lend out the remaining portion of the deposit, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Lendable Amount} = \\text{New Deposits} - \\text{Required Reserves}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Minimum Increase in Money Supply\nThe minimum increase in the money supply occurs when the bank does not lend out any of the new deposit. In this case, the bank simply holds the entire $700 as reserves, and no new money is created through lending.\n\nThus, the minimum increase in the money supply is the amount of the new deposit itself, which is $700.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Macroeconomics"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The choice in the Actual Output ('B') does not match the choice in the Expected Output ('A').", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.620150292001199, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 0}, {"name": "test_case_1", "input": "Question: <image 1> Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity, its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon.

This situation is typically characterized by:\n  - High demand (AD is high).\n  - Output exceeding the economy's long-run capacity (real output is to the right of LRAS).\n  - Rising prices (price level is above the long-run equilibrium level).\n\n### Role of Flexible Wages:\n- **Flexible wages** mean that wages can adjust quickly in response to changes in the economy.\n- During a boom, when output exceeds the economy's potential, firms may face higher costs due to increased demand for labor. This can lead to upward pressure on wages.\n\n### How Wages Adjust:\n1. **Wages Rise**: As firms compete for labor to meet the high demand, wages will increase.\n2. **Impact on SRAS**: Higher wages increase the cost of production for firms. This causes the SRAS curve to shift to the left, as firms are willing to supply less output at each price level due to higher costs.\n3. **New Equilibrium**: The leftward shift of the SRAS curve will bring the economy back to the long-run equilibrium, where the price level and output return to their potential levels (intersecting the LRAS curve).\n\n### Conclusion:\nIf wages are flexible, they will rise during a boom.

This creates an **excess supply** (or surplus) in the market.\n- **Market Dynamics**: In the presence of excess supply, sellers would have more pizzas than buyers are willing to purchase at the current price. To sell their excess inventory, sellers would be incentivized to lower the price. As the price decreases, the quantity demanded would increase, and the quantity supplied would decrease, moving the market toward the equilibrium price.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nIf the actual price is above the equilibrium price, the **excess supply** (surplus) would drive the market toward equilibrium. Sellers would lower the price to sell their excess inventory, reducing the surplus and moving the market back to the equilibrium point.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Principals of Economics"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The choice 'A' in the Actual Output matches the Expected Output, fulfilling the criteria.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.8282677080132999, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 9}, {"name": "test_case_11", "input": "Question: Consider the following table showing the breakdown of GDP (in billions) for China.  <image 1> What are net exports for China? \nChoices:\n(A) 10\n(B) 5\n(C) 20", "actualOutput": "To determine the net exports for China, we need to use the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Exports} = \\text{Exports} - \\text{Imports}\n\\]\n\nFrom the table, we can see the values for Exports and Imports:\n\n- Exports: 50 billion\n- Imports: 40 billion\n\nNow, we can calculate the net exports:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Exports} = 50 - 40 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the net exports for China are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Macroeconomics"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The choice 'A' in the actual output matches the expected output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.6492977919988334, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 11}, {"name": "test_case_12", "input": "Question: Suppose that a typical market based in Japan consists of 200 Apples and 290 Textbooks.

The intersection of the money supply and money demand determines the equilibrium interest rate.\n- **Effect of Increasing Money Supply**: When the central bank increases the money supply, the money supply curve shifts to the right. This leads to a lower equilibrium interest rate because the increased supply of money makes it cheaper to borrow.\n\n### Step 2: Linking the Money Market to the Aggregate Demand Curve\nA lower interest rate encourages borrowing and investment, which increases aggregate demand. This is because lower interest rates make it cheaper for businesses and consumers to borrow, leading to higher spending.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Diagram\nThe right diagram shows the aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) curves, with the price level (PL) on the vertical axis and GDP on the horizontal axis.\n\n- **Initial Equilibrium**: The intersection of the AD and AS curves determines the equilibrium price level and GDP.\n- **Effect of Lower Interest Rate on Aggregate Demand**: A lower interest rate shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right.

This suggests that the economy is operating above its potential output, which could lead to inflationary pressures but not necessarily high unemployment.\n   - **At Equilibrium (Price Level 80):** AD = AS, indicating that the economy is at its potential output. This is typically associated with the natural rate of unemployment, which is not considered high.\n   - **After Equilibrium (Price Level 90):** AD < AS, indicating excess supply.
