Assume that Eagle's assets are proportional to its sales. Find Eagle's required external funds if it maintains a dividend payout ratio of 50% and plans a growth rate of 15% in 2020.\nChoices:\n(A) $152.5\n(B) $162.5\n(C) $172.5\n(D) $182.5", "actualOutput": "To determine Eagle's required external funds, we need to use the **AFN (Additional Funds Needed) formula**. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nAFN = \\Delta Assets - \\Delta Liabilities - \\Delta Retained Earnings\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the change in assets (\\(\\Delta Assets\\))\nEagle's assets are proportional to its sales. The sales in 2019 were $950, and the company plans a growth rate of 15% in 2020. Therefore, the sales in 2020 will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sales}_{2020} = \\text{Sales}_{2019} \\times (1 + \\text{Growth Rate}) = 950 \\times 1.15 = 1092.5\n\\]\n\nThe total assets in 2019 were $3,000. Since assets are proportional to sales, the change in assets (\\(\\Delta Assets\\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Assets = \\text{Total Assets}_{2019} \\times \\text{Growth Rate} = 3000 \\times 0.15 = 450\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the change in liabilities (\\(\\Delta Liabilities\\))\nThe liabilities consist of debt and equity. The debt in 2019 was $1,000, and the equity was $2,000. Since the problem does not specify any change in the debt or equity structure, we assume that the debt and equity grow proportionally with assets. Therefore, the change in liabilities is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Liabilities = \\text{Total Liabilities}_{2019} \\times \\text{Growth Rate} = 3000 \\times 0.15 = 450\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the change in retained earnings (\\(\\Delta Retained Earnings\\))\nThe net income in 2019 was $500. The company maintains a dividend payout ratio of 50%, so the retention ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \\text{Dividend Payout Ratio} = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50\n\\]\n\nThe retained earnings in 2020 will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Retained Earnings}_{2020} = \\text{Net Income}_{2020} \\times \\text{Retention Ratio}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the net income for 2020. Since sales are growing by 15%, and assuming costs and tax rates remain constant, the net income will also grow by 15%:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Income}_{2020} = \\text{Net Income}_{2019} \\times (1 + \\text{Growth Rate}) = 500 \\times 1.15 = 575\n\\]\n\nThe change in retained earnings is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta Retained Earnings = \\text{Net Income}_{2020} \\times \\text{Retention Ratio} = 575 \\times 0.50 = 287.5\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the AFN\nNow, we can substitute the values into the AFN formula:\n\n\\[\nAFN = \\Delta Assets - \\Delta Liabilities - \\Delta Retained Earnings\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAFN = 450 - 450 - 287.5 = -287.5\n\\]\n\nSince the AFN is negative, it means the company has excess funds and does not need external funds. However, the problem asks for the required external funds, and the correct interpretation is that the company does not need any external funds.
