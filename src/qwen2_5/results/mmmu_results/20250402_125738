Plugging in the values:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{-0.5 - 0}{0.85 / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.85 / 3.162} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.269} \\approx -1.86\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Determine the p-value and make a decision\nThe degrees of freedom for the t-test is $n-1 = 10-1 = 9$. Using a t-table or calculator for a one-tailed test with $df = 9$ and $t = -1.86$, the p-value is approximately 0.047.
