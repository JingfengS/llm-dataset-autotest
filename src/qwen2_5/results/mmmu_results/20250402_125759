This can be approached using integer programming and the concept of a minimum vertex cover in graph theory.\n\n### Step 1: Represent the Problem as a Graph\nEach plan can be represented as a graph where:\n- **Nodes** represent rooms.\n- **Edges** represent doorways connecting two adjacent rooms.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of nodes (rooms) such that every edge (doorway) is incident to at least one of these nodes. This is known as the **minimum vertex cover** problem.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Plan (a)\n#### Graph Representation:\n- Plan (a) has 4 rooms (nodes) and 5 doorways (edges).\n- The graph can be visualized as a 2x2 grid with horizontal and vertical connections.\n\n#### Minimum Vertex Cover:\n- To cover all edges, we need to select a minimum set of nodes such that every edge is incident to at least one of these nodes.\n- In a 2x2 grid, selecting any two adjacent nodes (e.g., top-left and top-right) will cover all edges.\n- Therefore, the minimum vertex cover for plan (a) is 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Plan (b)\n#### Graph Representation:\n- Plan (b) has 4 rooms (nodes) and 5 doorways (edges).\n- The graph is similar to plan (a) but with an additional vertical doorway in the middle.\n\n#### Minimum Vertex Cover:\n- To cover all edges, we need to select a minimum set of nodes such that every edge is incident to at least one of these nodes.\n- In this configuration, selecting any two adjacent nodes (e.g., top-left and top-right) will not cover all edges because the additional vertical doorway in the middle will be uncovered.\n- Therefore, we need to select at least 3 nodes to cover all edges. For example, selecting the top-left, top-right, and bottom-middle nodes will cover all edges.\n- The minimum vertex cover for plan (b) is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n- For plan (a), the minimum number of attendants required is 2.\n- For plan (b), the minimum number of attendants required is 3.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{B}", "expectedOutput": "B", "context": ["Operation Research"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The choice 'B' in the Actual Output matches the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.5584610419755336, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 1}, {"name": "test_case_0", "input": "Question: Find $\\lim_{x \\to 2}\\left [ x \\right ]$ [As usual, [x] is the greatest integersee $\\le $ x, See Fig. 6-1] <image 1>\nChoices:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) Not exist", "actualOutput": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of the limit:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\to 2} \\lfloor x \\rfloor\n$$\n\nwhere \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the function \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\)\nThe function \\( \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\) (the floor function) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\( x \\).

Therefore, the objective function is:\n\\[\n\\text{Maximize } f(x) = 4,000x_1 + 7,000x_2\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Define the Constraints**\n1. **Investment Constraint**: The total cost of purchasing the boats cannot exceed $200,000.\n   \\[\n   25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000\n   \\]\n\n2. **Customer Capacity Constraint**: The total capacity of the boats must not exceed 6,000 customers per season.\n   \\[\n   1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Non-negativity Constraints**: The number of boats cannot be negative.\n   \\[\n   x_1 \\geq 0, \\quad x_2 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n### **Step 4: Graph the Constraints**\nWe need to graph the constraints to find the feasible region.\n\n1. **Investment Constraint**: \\( 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000 \\)\n   - When \\( x_1 = 0 \\): \\( 80,000x_2 = 200,000 \\implies x_2 = 2.5 \\)\n   - When \\( x_2 = 0 \\): \\( 25,000x_1 = 200,000 \\implies x_1 = 8 \\)\n   - The line is \\( 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 = 200,000 \\).\n\n2. **Customer Capacity Constraint**: \\( 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000 \\)\n   - When \\( x_1 = 0 \\): \\( 2,000x_2 = 6,000 \\implies x_2 = 3 \\)\n   - When \\( x_2 = 0 \\): \\( 1,200x_1 = 6,000 \\implies x_1 = 5 \\)\n   - The line is \\( 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 = 6,000 \\).\n\n3. **Non-negativity Constraints**: \\( x_1 \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x_2 \\geq 0 \\).\n\n### **Step 5: Identify the Feasible Region**\nThe feasible region is the area where all constraints are satisfied. From the graph, the feasible region is a polygon with vertices at points where the constraint lines intersect.\n\n### **Step 6: Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region**\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n1. \\( (0, 0) \\)\n2. \\( (0, 2.5) \\)\n3. \\( (5, 0) \\)\n4. The intersection of the two constraint lines:\n   \\[\n   25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 = 200,000\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 = 6,000\n   \\]\n\n#### Solve the system of equations:\n1. \\( 25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 = 200,000 \\)\n2. \\( 1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 = 6,000 \\)\n\nDivide the second equation by 200:\n\\[\n6x_1 + 10x_2 = 30 \\implies 3x_1 + 5x_2 = 15\n\\]\n\nDivide the first equation by 5,000:\n\\[\n5x_1 + 16x_2 = 40\n\\]\n\nNow solve the system:\n\\[\n3x_1 + 5x_2 = 15 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n5x_1 + 16x_2 = 40 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nMultiply equation (1) by 5 and equation (2) by 3:\n\\[\n15x_1 + 25x_2 = 75 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\\[\n15x_1 + 48x_2 = 120 \\quad \\text{(4)}\n\\]\n\nSubtract equation (3) from equation (4):\n\\[\n(15x_1 + 48x_2) - (15x_1 + 25x_2) = 120 - 75\n\\]\n\\[\n23x_2 = 45 \\implies x_2 = \\frac{45}{23} \\approx 1.96\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x_2 \\) back into equation (1):\n\\[\n3x_1 + 5\\left(\\frac{45}{23}\\right) = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n3x_1 + \\frac{225}{23} = 15\n\\]\n\\[\n3x_1 = 15 - \\frac{225}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\n3x_1 = \\frac{345}{23} - \\frac{225}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\n3x_1 = \\frac{120}{23}\n\\]\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{40}{23} \\approx 1.74\n\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is approximately \\( \\left( \\frac{40}{23}, \\frac{45}{23} \\right) \\).\n\n### **Step 7: Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex**\n1. At \\( (0, 0) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(0, 0) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(0) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. At \\( (0, 2.5) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(0, 2.5) = 4,000(0) + 7,000(2.5) = 17,500\n   \\]\n\n3. At \\( (5, 0) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(5, 0) = 4,000(5) + 7,000(0) = 20,000\n   \\]\n\n4. At \\( \\left( \\frac{40}{23}, \\frac{45}{23} \\right) \\):\n   \\[\n   f\\left( \\frac{40}{23}, \\frac{45}{23} \\right) = 4,000\\left( \\frac{40}{23} \\right) + 7,000\\left( \\frac{45}{23} \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{160,000}{23} + \\frac{315,000}{23} = \\frac{475,000}{23} \\approx 20,652.17\n   \\]\n\n### **Step 8: Determine the Optimal Solution**\nThe maximum value of the objective function is approximately 20,652.17, which occurs at the point \\( \\left( \\frac{40}{23}, \\frac{45}{23} \\right) \\). However, since the number of boats must be integers, we need to check the integer points near this solution.\n\nFrom the graph, the closest integer points are:\n- \\( (3, 2) \\):\n  \\[\n  f(3, 2) = 4,000(3) + 7,000(2) = 12,000 + 14,000 = 26,000\n  \\]\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe optimal solution is to purchase 3 boats of Type 1 and 2 boats of Type 2.

Since the hexagon is perfectly embedded in the octagon, the area of $ ABCD $ is simply the area of the trapezoid calculated above.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{16\\sqrt{3}}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "C", "context": ["Geometry"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The choice in the actual output is 'B', but the expected output is 'C'.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.014532291010255, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 12}, {"name": "test_case_13", "input": "Question: <image 1>The graph of y = f(x) is shown in the figure above.

Points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ lie on the sides of the square such that $APQCRS$ forms an equilateral convex hexagon with side length $s$. We need to determine the value of $s$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n- The square $ABCD$ has vertices $A = (0, 0)$, $B = (1, 0)$, $C = (1, 1)$, and $D = (0, 1)$.\n- Points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ lie on the sides of the square:\n  - $P$ is on $AB$,\n  - $Q$ is on $BC$,\n  - $R$ is on $CD$,\n  - $S$ is on $DA$.\n- The hexagon $APQCRS$ is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal, and all its internal angles are $120^\\circ$.\n\n#### 2. **Positioning the Points:**\n- Let $P = (x_1, 0)$, where $0 \\leq x_1 \\leq 1$.\n- Let $Q = (1, y_1)$, where $0 \\leq y_1 \\leq 1$.\n- Let $R = (x_2, 1)$, where $0 \\leq x_2 \\leq 1$.\n- Let $S = (0, y_2)$, where $0 \\leq y_2 \\leq 1$.\n\n#### 3. **Equilateral Hexagon Properties:**\n- Since $APQCRS$ is an equilateral hexagon, all its sides are equal to $s$. Therefore:\n  $$\n  AP = PQ = QC = CR = RS = SA = s.\n  $$\n\n#### 4. **Using Symmetry and Geometry:**\n- Due to the symmetry of the problem, the points $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are positioned such that the hexagon is centered around the square. This implies that the distances from the sides of the square to the points are equal in a symmetric manner.\n\n#### 5. **Coordinate Placement:**\n- Assume $P = (x, 0)$, $Q = (1, y)$, $R = (x, 1)$, and $S = (0, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are the same for symmetry.\n- The side length $s$ of the hexagon is the distance between consecutive points. For example, the distance $AP$ is:\n  $$\n  AP = \\sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = x.\n  $$\n- The distance $PQ$ is:\n  $$\n  PQ = \\sqrt{(1 - x)^2 + y^2}.\n  $$\n- The distance $QC$ is:\n  $$\n  QC = \\sqrt{(1 - 1)^2 + (1 - y)^2} = 1 - y.\n  $$\n- The distance $CR$ is:\n  $$\n  CR = \\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = 1 - x.\n  $$\n- The distance $RS$ is:\n  $$\n  RS = \\sqrt{x^2 + (1 - y)^2}.\n  $$\n- The distance $SA$ is:\n  $$\n  SA = \\sqrt{0^2 + y^2} = y.\n  $$\n\n#### 6. **Equating Side Lengths:**\n- Since all sides are equal to $s$, we have:\n  $$\n  AP = s \\implies x = s,\n  $$\n  $$\n  QC = s \\implies 1 - y = s \\implies y = 1 - s,\n  $$\n  $$\n  CR = s \\implies 1 - x = s \\implies x = 1 - s.\n  $$\n- From $x = s$ and $x = 1 - s$, we get:\n  $$\n  s = 1 - s \\implies 2s = 1 \\implies s = \\frac{1}{2}.\n  $$\n\n#### 7. **Verification:**\n- If $s = \\frac{1}{2}$, then:\n  $$\n  x = s = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad y = 1 - s = \\frac{1}{2}.\n  $$\n- The coordinates of the points are:\n  $$\n  P = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right), \\quad Q = \\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\quad R = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right), \\quad S = \\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right).\n  $$\n- The distance between any two consecutive points is:\n  $$\n  AP = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad PQ = \\sqrt{\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - 0\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n  $$\n- All other distances can be similarly verified to be equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "C", "context": ["Geometry"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output choice is 'E', but the expected output choice is 'C'.
