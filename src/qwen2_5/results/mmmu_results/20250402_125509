A decrease in pH means the solution becomes more acidic.\n- **Transport Proteins**: Many transport proteins, including those involved in active transport (like the sodium-glucose cotransporter), are sensitive to pH changes. Changes in pH can affect the conformation of these proteins, potentially altering their function.\n\n### Effect of Decreased pH (More Acidic Environment):\n1. **Protein Conformation**: A decrease in pH can lead to protonation of amino acid residues in the transport protein, which might alter its shape and function.\n2. **Transport Efficiency**: Depending on the specific protein, a more acidic environment could either:\n   - **Increase** transport if the protein's conformation becomes more favorable for binding and transporting substrates.\n   - **Decrease** transport if the protein's structure is destabilized or its binding affinity for substrates is reduced.\n\n### Specific to Amino Acids:\n- The image does not explicitly show amino acid transport, but if we assume a similar transport mechanism (e.g., a cotransporter that uses sodium gradients), the following could occur:\n  - If the pH decrease affects the sodium gradient (e.g., by altering the activity of the sodium-potassium pump or other ion channels), it could indirectly impact amino acid transport.\n  - If the transport protein for amino acids is pH-sensitive and its function is impaired at lower pH, amino acid transport would likely **decrease**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the general sensitivity of transport proteins to pH changes and the potential for decreased function under more acidic conditions, it is reasonable to expect that a decrease in pH outside the cell would **decrease** the amount of amino acids transported into the cell.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Cell Biology"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The choice in the Actual Output ('B') does not match the choice in the Expected Output ('A').", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.6651137500011828, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 2}, {"name": "test_case_4", "input": "Question: What is part B in the figure? <image 1>\nChoices:\n(A) Sheath\n(B) Viral genome\n(C) Capsid\n(D) Tail Fibers", "actualOutput": "To identify part B in the figure, let's analyze the structure of the virus depicted:\n\n1. **A**: This appears to be the outer shell of the virus, which is typically called the **capsid**.

The crow needs to ensure that the whelk lands on a hard surface and breaks open, while also maintaining awareness of its surroundings to avoid being interrupted by other birds.\n\n### Analysis of the Flight Paths:\n1. **Flight Path A**:\n   - The crow flies in a straight, downward path.\n   - This path is direct and minimizes the time and energy spent in the air.\n   - However, the crow may not have a good view of the landing area or the surrounding environment while in this path.\n\n2. **Flight Path B**:\n   - The crow flies in an arc, gaining height before descending.\n   - This path allows the crow to achieve greater height, which increases the force with which the whelk hits the ground, potentially making it easier to break the shell.\n   - Additionally, the arc provides the crow with a better view of the landing area and the surrounding environment, reducing the risk of being interrupted by other birds.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n- **Option (A)**: \"Flight Path A: the crow has a wider view of his surroundings to assure that another bird will not steal the whelk.\"\n  - While this is a valid concern, Flight Path A does not provide a wider view of the surroundings.

For an individual to be affected by an AR disease:\n- They must inherit one defective allele from each parent.\n- If an individual has one defective allele and one normal allele, they are a **carrier** but not affected.\n- If an individual has two normal alleles, they are neither affected nor a carrier.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the given information\n- Individual #1 is a **heterozygote** for the disease, meaning they have one defective allele and one normal allele (genotype: **Aa**).\n- Individual #2 is not a carrier, meaning they have two normal alleles (genotype: **AA**).\n- The spouses of individuals #3 and #4 are not carriers, meaning they have two normal alleles (genotype: **AA**).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the genotypes of individuals #3 and #4\n- Individual #3 is the offspring of #1 (Aa) and #2 (AA).\n  - The possible genotypes for #3 are:\n    - A (from #1) + A (from #2) = AA\n    - a (from #1) + A (from #2) = Aa\n  - Since #3 is not affected, they cannot be homozygous recessive (aa). Therefore, #3 is either **AA** or **Aa**.\n  - However, since #3 is not a carrier (as per the problem statement), #3 must be **AA**.\n\n- Individual #4 is the offspring of #1 (Aa) and #2 (AA).\n  - The possible genotypes for #4 are the same as for #3:\n    - A (from #1) + A (from #2) = AA\n    - a (from #1) + A (from #2) = Aa\n  - Since #4 is not affected, they cannot be homozygous recessive (aa). Therefore, #4 is either **AA** or **Aa**.\n  - However, since #4 is not a carrier (as per the problem statement), #4 must be **AA**.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the genotypes of individuals #5 and #6\n- Individual #5 is the offspring of #3 (AA) and a non-carrier spouse (AA).\n  - The only possible genotype for #5 is:\n    - A (from #3) + A (from spouse) = AA\n  - Therefore, #5 is **AA**.\n\n- Individual #6 is the offspring of #4 (AA) and a non-carrier spouse (AA).\n  - The only possible genotype for #6 is:\n    - A (from #4) + A (from spouse) = AA\n  - Therefore, #6 is **AA**.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the genotype of individual #7\n- Individual #7 is the offspring of #5 (AA) and #6 (AA).\n  - The only possible genotype for #7 is:\n    - A (from #5) + A (from #6) = AA\n  - Therefore, #7 is **AA**.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nSince #7 has the genotype **AA**, they do not have the disease and cannot be affected.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "1/64", "context": ["Genetics"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output choice is '0', but the expected output choice is '1/64'.

It stimulates the release of glucose from the liver, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels.\n\n### Analyzing the Statements:\n#### I. **Normal homeostatic mechanisms maintain a glucose concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml.**\n- The graph shows that the blood glucose level at the start (Point A) is 1.0 mg/ml, and it returns to around 1.0 mg/ml after the fluctuations.
