Since the resistors are identical, the resistance in each path is the same. This means the potential drop across each path will be the same, and the voltage across corresponding points in the two paths will be equal.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Points\n- **Top path**: T \u2192 S \u2192 Q \u2192 P\n- **Bottom path**: T \u2192 W \u2192 U \u2192 P\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Voltage Drops\nSince the resistors are identical and the paths are parallel, the voltage drop across each resistor in the top path will be equal to the voltage drop across the corresponding resistor in the bottom path. This is because the current splits equally between the two paths (due to identical resistances), and the voltage drop across each resistor is proportional to its resistance.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Voltage Differences\n- The voltage difference between **Q** and **U** will be zero because they are at the same potential. This is because both points are at the same position in their respective paths (second resistor from the bottom in each path).\n- Similarly, the voltage difference between **S** and **W** will be zero for the same reason (first resistor from the bottom in each path).\n- The voltage difference between **P** and **T** will not be zero because these are the endpoints of the circuit, and there is a potential difference across the entire circuit.\n- The voltage difference between **Q** and **W** will not be zero because they are not at the same position in their respective paths.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe voltmeter will read zero when connected between points **Q** and **U** because they are at the same potential.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}", "expectedOutput": "A", "context": ["Electromagnetism"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The choice 'A' in the actual output matches the expected output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the choice made ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D') in actual_output is exactly match with choice in expected output\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results are fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.509219416999258, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 26}, {"name": "test_case_27", "input": "Question: <image 1>A picture P of weight W is hung by two strings as shown.
