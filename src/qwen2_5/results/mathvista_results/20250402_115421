The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.

ABCD is a square.\n   - O is the center of the inscribed circle.\n   - The circle is tangent to all four sides of the square.\n   - M is the midpoint of the side AD.\n   - K is the intersection of the diagonal AC and the line segment BM.\n\n2. **Coordinate System Setup:**\n   - Let the side length of the square be \\( s \\).\n   - Place the square in a coordinate system with:\n     - \\( A = (0, 0) \\)\n     - \\( B = (0, s) \\)\n     - \\( C = (s, s) \\)\n     - \\( D = (s, 0) \\)\n   -

The lengths of the segments are as follows:\n- \\( KL = 17 \\)\n- \\( ML = 10 \\)\n- \\( MK = x \\) (the radius of the circle)\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( x \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Right Triangle:**\n   Since \\( KL \\) is tangent to the circle at \\( K \\), the radius \\( MK \\) is perpendicular to \\( KL \\). Therefore, \\( \\triangle MKL \\) is a right triangle with:\n   - \\( MK \\) as one leg (radius of the circle, \\( x \\)),\n   - \\( KL \\) as the other leg (tangent segment, 17),\n   - \\( ML \\) as the hypotenuse (10).\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n   In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \\text{Leg}_1^2 + \\text{Leg}_2^2\n   \\]\n   Here, the hypotenuse is \\( ML = 10 \\), one leg is \\( MK = x \\), and the other leg is \\( KL = 17 \\).

The inscribed angle subtended by the same arc \\( \\widehat{AB} \\) is half of the central angle.

Polynomials of odd degree have end behaviors where one end goes to \\( +\\infty \\) and the other end goes to \\( -\\infty \\).\n\n### Step 2: Count the Number of Turning Points\n- A turning point is a point where the function changes direction from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.\n- From the graph, we can see that there is exactly one turning point.\n\nFor a polynomial function, the number of turning points is at most one less than the degree of the polynomial. If the degree of the polynomial is \\( n \\), then the maximum number of turning points is \\( n-1 \\).\n\nSince there is exactly one turning point, the degree of the polynomial must be at least 3 (because a polynomial of degree 2 can have at most one turning point, but it would not have the observed end behavior).\n\n### Step 3: Confirm the Degree\n- A polynomial of degree 3 (a cubic polynomial) can have up to 2 turning points, but it can also have exactly 1 turning point, which matches our observation.\n- A polynomial of degree 5 or higher could also have exactly 1 turning point, but the simplest polynomial that fits all the observed characteristics is a cubic polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the degree of the function is 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "3", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the degree of the function as 3, which matches the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.5791482499917038, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 119}, {"name": "test_case_120", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: In trying to calculate how much money could be saved by packing lunch, Manny recorded the amount he spent on lunch each day.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design. Which of the following could Cooper's test show?\nChoices:\n(A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design\n(B) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area\n(C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road", "actualOutput": "To determine which of the options Cooper's test could show, let's analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Problem Description**: Cooper was tasked with designing a park that meets specific requirements:\n   - Space for outdoor concerts.\n   - At least 20% of the park shaded by trees.\n   - The concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road to minimize traffic noise.\n\n2. **Cooper's Approach**:\n   - He developed three possible designs with the concert area in different locations.\n   - He tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\n\n3. **Focus of the Test**: The test specifically involved measuring the distance between the road and the concert area. This directly relates to the requirement that the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road to minimize traffic noise.\n\n### Analysis of the Options:\n- **(A) if at least 20% of the park would be shaded by trees in each design**:\n  - The test described in the passage does not involve measuring the shading provided by trees. Therefore, this option is not supported by the information provided.\n\n- **(B) which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area**:\n  - The test measured the distance between the road and the concert area. Since the concert area's distance from the road is directly related to the level of traffic noise, this test could help determine which design would have the least traffic noise. This option is supported by the information.\n\n- **(C) which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road**:\n  - While the test measured the distance between the road and the concert area, the goal was to ensure the distance was at least 150 meters, not necessarily to find the greatest distance. Therefore, this option is not the primary focus of the test.\n\n### Correct Answer:\nThe test could show **which design would have the least traffic noise in the concert area** because measuring the distance between the road and the concert area directly relates to the noise level.\n\n**Answer: B**", "expectedOutput": "which design would have the greatest distance between the concert area and the road", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The Actual Output provides the correct answer as 'B', but the Expected Output specifies 'C'.

This is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening upwards.\n\n2. **Graphical Interpretation:**\n   From the graph provided:\n   - The function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is symmetric about the \\( y \\)-axis.\n   - For any positive \\( y \\)-value, there are two corresponding \\( x \\)-values, one positive and one negative. For example:\n     - If \\( f(x) = 4 \\), then \\( x = 2 \\) or \\( x = -2 \\).\n     - If \\( f(x) = 1 \\), then \\( x = 1 \\) or \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n3. **Checking Injectivity:**\n   - For a function to be injective, each output must correspond to a unique input.\n   - However, in the case of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), we see that:\n     \\[\n     f(2) = 4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(-2) = 4.\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( f(2) = f(-2) \\), but \\( 2 \\neq -2 \\). This violates the condition for injectivity.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since there exist distinct inputs \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) such that \\( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\) but \\( x_1 \\neq x_2 \\), the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is not injective.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "No", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the function as not injective, matching the Expected Output 'No' and providing a valid explanation.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.8334970409923699, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 136}, {"name": "test_case_137", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is the sandwich cut in half?\nChoices:\n(A) Yes\n(B) No", "actualOutput": "To determine if the sandwich is cut in half, let's analyze the image:\n\n1.

The average kinetic energy (\\(KE\\)) of a particle is given by the equation:\n\n\\[\nKE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\(m\\) is the mass of the particle,\n- \\(v\\) is the velocity of the particle.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the given information\n- **Sample A**:\n  - Mass of each particle: \\(44 \\, \\text{u}\\)\n  - Average particle speed: \\(1,400 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n- **Sample B**:\n  - Mass of each particle: \\(46 \\, \\text{u}\\)\n  - Average particle speed: \\(1,400 \\, \\text{m/s}\\)\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the average kinetic energy for each sample\nThe average kinetic energy for a particle in each sample can be calculated using the formula \\(KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\).\n\n#### For Sample A:\n\\[\nKE_A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 44 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,400 \\, \\text{m/s})^2\n\\]\n\n#### For Sample B:\n\\[\nKE_B = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 46 \\, \\text{u} \\times (1,400 \\, \\text{m/s})^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the kinetic energies\nSince the average particle speed (\\(v\\)) is the same for both samples, the kinetic energy will be directly proportional to the mass of the particles. \n\n- For Sample A: \\(KE_A \\propto 44 \\, \\text{u}\\)\n- For Sample B: \\(KE_B \\propto 46 \\, \\text{u}\\)\n\nBecause the mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A, the average kinetic energy of the particles in Sample B will be higher than that in Sample A.\n\n### Step 4: Relate kinetic energy to temperature\nThe average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will have the higher temperature.\n\nSince \\(KE_B > KE_A\\), it follows that the temperature of Sample B is higher than the temperature of Sample A.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "sample B", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies 'B' as the answer, which matches the Expected Output 'sample B'.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.9043368750135414, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 146}, {"name": "test_case_147", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Which leaf shape has the smallest base?\nChoices:\n(A) Hastate\n(B) Cordate\n(C) Sagittate\n(D) Decurrent", "actualOutput": "To determine which leaf shape has the smallest base, let's analyze each option based on the provided diagram and descriptions:\n\n1. **Oblique**: The base is asymmetrical, with one side longer than the other.

One wants to do histogram specification SO that the processed image will have the specified $p_z(z)$ shown in Fig. Q1b. Can we use intensity mapping function $T: z=1-r$ to achieve the goal?\nChoices:\n(A) True\n(B) False", "actualOutput": "To determine whether the intensity mapping function $ z = 1 - r $ can achieve the desired histogram specification, we need to analyze the given probability density functions (PDFs) in Fig. Q1a and Fig. Q1b.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the PDFs\n- **Fig. Q1a**: The PDF $ p_r(r) $ is a decreasing linear function of $ r $, starting at $ p_r(0) = 2 $ and ending at $ p_r(1) = 0 $. This indicates a uniform distribution that decreases linearly from $ r = 0 $ to $ r = 1 $.\n- **Fig. Q1b**: The PDF $ p_z(z) $ is an increasing linear function of $ z $, starting at $ p_z(0) = 0 $ and ending at $ p_z(1) = 2 $. This indicates a uniform distribution that increases linearly from $ z = 0 $ to $ z = 1 $.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the proposed mapping function\nThe proposed mapping function is:\n$$\nz = 1 - r\n$$\nThis function maps the range of $ r $ (from 0 to 1) to the range of $ z $ (from 1 to 0). Specifically:\n- When $ r = 0 $, $ z = 1 - 0 = 1 $.\n- When $ r = 1 $, $ z = 1 - 1 = 0 $.\n\n### Step 3: Check if the mapping achieves the desired PDF\nThe mapping $ z = 1 - r $ reverses the order of the values. However, the shapes of the PDFs in Fig. Q1a and Fig. Q1b are mirror images of each other. Specifically:\n- In Fig. Q1a, $ p_r(r) $ decreases linearly from $ r = 0 $ to $ r = 1 $.\n- In Fig. Q1b, $ p_z(z) $ increases linearly from $ z = 0 $ to $ z = 1 $.\n\nThe mapping $ z = 1 - r $ will transform the decreasing linear PDF $ p_r(r) $ into an increasing linear PDF $ p_z(z) $, which matches the desired shape in Fig. Q1b.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the transformation\nTo verify, consider the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs):\n- The CDF of $ p_r(r) $ is:\n  $$\n  C_r(r) = \\int_0^r p_r(r') \\, dr' = \\int_0^r (2 - 2r') \\, dr' = 2r - r^2\n  $$\n- The CDF of $ p_z(z) $ is:\n  $$\n  C_z(z) = \\int_0^z p_z(z') \\, dz' = \\int_0^z 2z' \\, dz' = z^2\n  $$\n\nUsing the mapping $ z = 1 - r $, we can transform the CDF of $ p_r(r) $:\n$$\nC_z(z) = C_r(1 - z)\n$$\nSubstitute $ r = 1 - z $ into $ C_r(r) $:\n$$\nC_r(1 - z) = 2(1 - z) - (1 - z)^2 = 2 - 2z - (1 - 2z + z^2) = 2 - 2z - 1 + 2z - z^2 = 1 - z^2\n$$\nThis does not directly match $ C_z(z) = z^2 $. However, the shapes of the PDFs are consistent with the mapping, and the transformation $ z = 1 - r $ correctly reverses the order and shape of the distribution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe mapping function $ z = 1 - r $ will transform the PDF $ p_r(r) $ into the desired PDF $ p_z(z) $.

If the incident angle is \u03b1, AC \u22a5 CD, BD \u22a5 CD, the feet of perpendicular are C, D, and AC = 3.0, BD = 6.0, CD = 10.0, then the length of the line segment ED is ()\nChoices:\n(A) \\frac{20}{3}\n(B) \\frac{10}{3}\n(C) 7\n(D) \\frac{14}{3}", "actualOutput": "### Problem Analysis:\nWe are given a scenario where a light ray is emitted from point $A$, reflects off a plane mirror $CD$ at point $E$, and reaches point $B$. The goal is to find the length of the segment $ED$, given the following information:\n- $AC \\perp CD$ and $BD \\perp CD$, so $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular distances from points $A$ and $B$ to the mirror $CD$.\n- $AC = 3.0$, $BD = 6.0$, and $CD = 10.0$.\n- The incident angle at point $E$ is $\\alpha$, and the law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use the principle of reflection and the concept of virtual images. Specifically, we will reflect point $B$ across the mirror $CD$ to a virtual point $B'$, and then use the properties of similar triangles to find the length of $ED$.\n\n### Step 1: Reflect Point $B$ Across the Mirror $CD$\nWhen point $B$ is reflected across the mirror $CD$, its virtual image $B'$ will be such that:\n- The distance from $B'$ to the mirror $CD$ is equal to the distance from $B$ to the mirror $CD$, i.e., $B'D = BD = 6.0$.\n- The coordinates of $B'$ can be thought of as being directly above $D$ at a distance of 6.0 units.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Principle of Reflection\nThe path of the light ray from $A$ to $B$ via the mirror $CD$ at point $E$ is equivalent to the straight-line path from $A$ to $B'$. Therefore, the point $E$ is the point on $CD$ such that the straight-line segment $AB'$ intersects $CD$.\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Coordinates\nLet us place the points in a coordinate system for clarity:\n- Let $C = (0, 0)$ and $D = (10, 0)$, so the mirror $CD$ lies along the x-axis.\n- Point $A$ is at $(0, 3)$ because $AC = 3.0$.\n- Point $B$ is at $(10, 6)$ because $BD = 6.0$.\n- The virtual image $B'$ is at $(10, -6)$ because it is reflected across the x-axis.\n\n### Step 4: Equation of Line $AB'$\nThe line $AB'$ passes through points $A = (0, 3)$ and $B' = (10, -6)$. The slope of $AB'$ is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope of } AB' = \\frac{-6 - 3}{10 - 0} = \\frac{-9}{10}\n\\]\nThe equation of the line $AB'$ in slope-intercept form is:\n\\[\ny = mx + b \\implies y = -\\frac{9}{10}x + 3\n\\]\nThis line intersects the x-axis (mirror $CD$) at point $E$. At point $E$, the y-coordinate is 0. Setting $y = 0$ in the equation of the line:\n\\[\n0 = -\\frac{9}{10}x + 3 \\implies \\frac{9}{10}x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{30}{9} = \\frac{10}{3}\n\\]\nThus, the x-coordinate of point $E$ is $\\frac{10}{3}$. Since $E$ lies on the x-axis, its coordinates are $\\left(\\frac{10}{3}, 0\\right)$.\n\n### Step 5: Length of Segment $ED$\nThe length of segment $ED$ is the distance from point $E = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}, 0\\right)$ to point $D = (10, 0)$. This distance is:\n\\[\nED = 10 - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{30}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{20}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "\\frac{20}{3}", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the length of segment ED as \\frac{20}{3}, which matches the Expected Output.

We need to find the measure of \\( \\angle EOD \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:**\n   - Since \\( G \\) is the midpoint of chord \\( EF \\), the diameter \\( CD \\) is perpendicular to the chord \\( EF \\). This is a property of circles: a diameter that passes through the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to that chord.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle EGD = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle FGD = 90^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**\n   - The angle \\( \\angle DCF \\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \\( DF \\). According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n   - Therefore, the measure of arc \\( DF \\) is \\( 2 \\times \\angle DCF = 2 \\times 20^\\circ = 40^\\circ \\).\n\n3. **Central Angle Corresponding to Arc \\( DF \\):**\n   - The central angle \\( \\angle DOF \\) subtends the same arc \\( DF \\). The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle DOF = 40^\\circ \\).\n\n4. **Symmetry and Chord Properties:**\n   - Since \\( G \\) is the midpoint of \\( EF \\), the chord \\( EF \\) is symmetric with respect to the diameter \\( CD \\). This means that the arc \\( EF \\) is divided into two equal arcs by the diameter \\( CD \\).\n   - Therefore, the arc \\( EF \\) is twice the arc \\( DF \\), and the central angle \\( \\angle EOD \\) is twice the central angle \\( \\angle DOF \\).\n\n5. **Calculating \\( \\angle EOD \\):**\n   - Since \\( \\angle DOF = 40^\\circ \\), the central angle \\( \\angle EOD \\) is also \\( 40^\\circ \\) because the arc \\( EF \\) is symmetric and the central angle \\( \\angle EOD \\) subtends the same arc \\( EF \\).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "40\u00b0", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the answer as 'C', which corresponds to 40\u00b0, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.9217605839949101, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 191}, {"name": "test_case_192", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: Subtract all red things.

Since the system is cylindrical and symmetric, we use a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $ r $ and length $ L $.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface\nThe Gaussian surface is located at $ r = 2.00 R_2 $, which is outside both the rod and the shell. Therefore, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the sum of the charges on the rod and the shell:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{enc}} = Q_1 + Q_2\n$$\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$\nQ_2 = -2.00 Q_1 = -2.00 \\times 3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{C} = -6.80 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{C}\n$$\nThus:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{enc}} = Q_1 + Q_2 = 3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{C} - 6.80 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{C} = -3.40 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Apply Gauss's law\nGauss's law states:\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nFor a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $ r $ and length $ L $, the electric field $ \\mathbf{E} $ is radial and has the same magnitude at every point on the surface.

They either grow or decay monotonically depending on the value of \\( a \\).\n   - For \\( 0 < a < 1 \\) (as in this case with \\( a = 0.5 \\)), the function \\( a^x \\) decays as \\( x \\) increases. Specifically, \\( 0.5^x \\) approaches 0 as \\( x \\to \\infty \\) and grows without bound as \\( x \\to -\\infty \\).\n\n3. **Periodicity Check:**\n   - A periodic function repeats its values in regular intervals. For \\( g(x) = 0.5^x \\), we need to check if there exists a positive number \\( T \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     g(x + T) = g(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( g(x) = 0.5^x \\):\n     \\[\n     g(x + T) = 0.5^{x + T} = 0.5^x \\cdot 0.5^T.\n     \\]\n   - For \\( g(x + T) \\) to equal \\( g(x) \\), we would need:\n     \\[\n     0.5^x \\cdot 0.5^T = 0.5^x.\n     \\]\n   - Dividing both sides by \\( 0.5^x \\) (which is valid for all \\( x \\) since \\( 0.5^x > 0 \\)):\n     \\[\n     0.5^T = 1.\n     \\]\n   - The equation \\( 0.5^T = 1 \\) has no solution for \\( T > 0 \\) because \\( 0.5^T \\) is always less than 1 for \\( T > 0 \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no positive \\( T \\) such that \\( g(x + T) = g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\), the function \\( g(x) = 0.5^x \\) is not periodic.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "No", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the function as non-periodic, matching the Expected Output 'No'.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.20415191698703, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 223}, {"name": "test_case_222", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is this an even function?\nChoices:\n(A) Yes\n(B) No", "actualOutput": "To determine whether the given function is even, we need to recall the definition of an even function.

(The present global mean temperature is $290 \\mathrm{~K}$, and the equilibrium vapour pressure of water at that temperature is 0.0189 bar.)", "actualOutput": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relative increase in water vapor content in the atmosphere based on a temperature rise of 2.0 K, assuming that the relative humidity remains constant. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between temperature and vapor pressure\nThe equilibrium vapor pressure of water increases exponentially with temperature. This relationship is described by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which can be approximated as:\n\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the vapor pressures at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively,\n- $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ is the enthalpy of vaporization of water,\n- $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nHowever, for small temperature changes, we can use a simpler approximation based on the fact that the vapor pressure of water increases approximately exponentially with temperature. The relative increase in vapor pressure can be approximated using the following relationship:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx e^{L \\Delta T / R T_1^2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $L$ is the latent heat of vaporization of water (approximately $2.45 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{J/kg}$),\n- $\\Delta T$ is the change in temperature,\n- $R$ is the specific gas constant for water vapor ($461.5 \\, \\text{J/kg\u00b7K}$),\n- $T_1$ is the initial temperature.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the approximation\nGiven:\n- Initial temperature, $T_1 = 290 \\, \\text{K}$,\n- Temperature increase, $\\Delta T = 2.0 \\, \\text{K}$,\n- Latent heat of vaporization, $L = 2.45 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{J/kg}$,\n- Specific gas constant for water vapor, $R = 461.5 \\, \\text{J/kg\u00b7K}$.\n\nThe relative increase in vapor pressure is given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx e^{L \\Delta T / R T_1^2}\n$$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\n$$\n\\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\approx e^{\\frac{2.45 \\times 10^6 \\times 2.0}{461.5 \\times (290)^2}}\n$$\n\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2.45 \\times 10^6 \\times 2.0}{461.5 \\times (290)^2} = \\frac{4.9 \\times 10^6}{461.5 \\times 84100} = \\frac{4.9 \\times 10^6}{38801150} \\approx 0.1263\n$$\n\nNow, calculate the exponential:\n\n$$\ne^{0.1263} \\approx 1.135\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Interpret the result\nThe relative increase in water vapor content is approximately 1.135, which means the water vapor content increases by about 13.5%.

We need to find the length of $ CD $.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### **Step 1: Use the properties of the right triangle and the altitude.**\nIn a right triangle, the altitude drawn from the right angle to the hypotenuse creates two smaller right triangles that are similar to the original triangle and to each other. Specifically:\n- $ \\triangle ADB \\sim \\triangle ADC \\sim \\triangle ABC $.\n\n#### **Step 2: Use the given information and the similarity of triangles.**\nSince $ AD $ is the altitude, we can use the fact that the area of $ \\triangle ABC $ can be expressed in two ways:\n1. Using the base $ AB $ and height $ AC $:\n   $$\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB \\cdot AC.\n   $$\n2. Using the hypotenuse $ BC $ and the altitude $ AD $:\n   $$\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC \\cdot AD.\n   $$\n\nHowever, we will use the similarity of triangles to find the required length.\n\n#### **Step 3: Use the similarity of $ \\triangle ADE $ and $ \\triangle ABC $.**\nSince $ DE \\perp AB $, $ \\triangle ADE $ is similar to $ \\triangle ABC $ (both are right triangles, and they share $ \\angle BAC $).

Then:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{x} = \\frac{3}{y} \\implies 2y = 3x \\implies y = \\frac{3x}{2}.\n$$\n\n#### **Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem in $ \\triangle ABC $.**\nIn $ \\triangle ABC $, we have:\n$$\nAB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2.\n$$\nLet $ AB = b $ and $ AC = x $. Then:\n$$\nb^2 + x^2 = y^2.\n$$\nSince $ y = \\frac{3x}{2} $, we substitute:\n$$\nb^2 + x^2 = \\left( \\frac{3x}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9x^2}{4}.\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\nb^2 = \\frac{9x^2}{4} - x^2 = \\frac{9x^2}{4} - \\frac{4x^2}{4} = \\frac{5x^2}{4}.\n$$\nThus:\n$$\nb = \\frac{x\\sqrt{5}}{2}.\n$$\n\n#### **Step 5: Use the similarity of $ \\triangle ADB $ and $ \\triangle ADC $.**\nFrom the similarity of $ \\triangle ADB $ and $ \\triangle ADC $, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{AD}{DB} = \\frac{CD}{AD}.\n$$\nLet $ BD = m $ and $ CD = n $.

Since $ AD = 3 $, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{m} = \\frac{n}{3} \\implies 9 = mn \\implies m = \\frac{9}{n}.\n$$\nAlso, from the Pythagorean theorem in $ \\triangle ADB $ and $ \\triangle ADC $, we have:\n$$\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2.\n$$\nSubstituting $ AB = \\frac{x\\sqrt{5}}{2} $ and $ AC = x $, we get:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{x\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 = 3^2 + m^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x^2 = 3^2 + n^2.\n$$\nFrom $ x^2 = 9 + n^2 $, we have:\n$$\nx = \\sqrt{9 + n^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $ x = \\sqrt{9 + n^2} $ into $ AB = \\frac{x\\sqrt{5}}{2} $, we get:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{9 + n^2} \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^2 = 9 + m^2.\n$$\nSimplifying, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{5(9 + n^2)}{4} = 9 + m^2.\n$$\nSince $ m = \\frac{9}{n} $, we substitute and solve for $ n $:\n$$\n\\frac{5(9 + n^2)}{4} = 9 + \\left( \\frac{9}{n} \\right)^2 = 9 + \\frac{81}{n^2}.\n$$\nMultiplying through by $ 4n^2 $, we get:\n$$\n5n^2(9 + n^2) = 4n^2 \\cdot 9 + 4 \\cdot 81 \\implies 45n^2 + 5n^4 = 36n^2 + 324 \\implies 5n^4 + 9n^2 - 324 = 0.\n$$\nLet $ u = n^2 $.

All sides are equal in length.\n2. All interior angles are equal.\n3. The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by:\n   \\[\n   (n-2) \\times 180^\\circ = (6-2) \\times 180^\\circ = 720^\\circ\n   \\]\n   Since it is a regular hexagon, each interior angle is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{720^\\circ}{6} = 120^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. The hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center \\( O \\) to each vertex. Each of these triangles is congruent, and the central angle of each triangle is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{360^\\circ}{6} = 60^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Understanding the Central Angle \\( \\angle BOE \\)\nThe angle \\( \\angle BOE \\) is a central angle of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, the central angles are evenly distributed around the center \\( O \\). Each central angle subtended by two adjacent vertices (e.g., \\( \\angle BOA \\), \\( \\angle AOB \\), etc.) is \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\nIn the figure, \\( \\angle BOE \\) spans two of these central angles. Therefore, the measure of \\( \\angle BOE \\) is:\n\\[\n2 \\times 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the value of \\( x \\), which is the measure of \\( \\angle BOE \\) in the context of the given figure. From the figure, it is clear that \\( \\angle BOE \\) is actually half of the central angle spanning two vertices, which is:\n\\[\n\\frac{120^\\circ}{2} = 60^\\circ\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Conclusion\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\( 60^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "60", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the answer as 'B', which corresponds to '60', matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.6527350829856005, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 279}, {"name": "test_case_275", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: As shown in the figure, it is known that the radius of \u2299O is 5.0 and the chord AB = 8.0, then the distance from the center O to AB is ()\nChoices:\n(A) 1mm\n(B) 2mm\n(C) 3mm\n(D) 4mm", "actualOutput": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from the center \\( O \\) of the circle to the chord \\( AB \\).

Set up the initial value problem that describes this flow process. By finding the amount of salt $Q(t)$ in the tank at any time, and the limiting amount $Q_L$ that is present after a very long time, if $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L$, find the time $T$ after which the salt level is within $2 \\%$ of $Q_L$.", "actualOutput": "### Problem Setup and Initial Value Problem\n\nWe are given a tank that initially contains $ Q_0 \\, \\mathrm{lb} $ of salt dissolved in 100 gallons of water. Water containing $ \\frac{1}{4} \\, \\mathrm{lb} $ of salt per gallon is entering the tank at a rate of $ r \\, \\mathrm{gal/min} $, and the well-stirred mixture is draining from the tank at the same rate. We need to set up the initial value problem, solve for the amount of salt $ Q(t) $ in the tank at any time, and determine the time $ T $ after which the salt level is within $ 2\\% $ of the limiting amount $ Q_L $.\n\n#### Step 1: Set up the differential equation\nThe rate of change of the amount of salt $ Q(t) $ in the tank is given by the difference between the rate at which salt enters the tank and the rate at which salt leaves the tank.\n\n1. **Rate of salt entering the tank:**\n   The incoming water contains $ \\frac{1}{4} \\, \\mathrm{lb} $ of salt per gallon and enters at a rate of $ r \\, \\mathrm{gal/min} $. Therefore, the rate of salt entering is:\n   $$\n   \\text{Rate in} = r \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{r}{4} \\, \\mathrm{lb/min}.\n   $$\n\n2. **Rate of salt leaving the tank:**\n   The tank is well-stirred, so the concentration of salt in the tank at any time is $ \\frac{Q(t)}{100} \\, \\mathrm{lb/gal} $. The mixture leaves the tank at the same rate $ r \\, \\mathrm{gal/min} $. Therefore, the rate of salt leaving is:\n   $$\n   \\text{Rate out} = r \\cdot \\frac{Q(t)}{100} = \\frac{r Q(t)}{100} \\, \\mathrm{lb/min}.\n   $$\n\n3. **Differential equation:**\n   The rate of change of the amount of salt in the tank is:\n   $$\n   \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\text{Rate in} - \\text{Rate out} = \\frac{r}{4} - \\frac{r Q(t)}{100}.\n   $$\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   $$\n   \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{r}{4} - \\frac{r Q(t)}{100} = \\frac{r}{4} \\left( 1 - \\frac{Q(t)}{25} \\right).\n   $$\n\n4. **Initial condition:**\n   At $ t = 0 $, the amount of salt in the tank is $ Q_0 $. Therefore, the initial condition is:\n   $$\n   Q(0) = Q_0.\n   $$\n\nThe initial value problem is:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\frac{r}{4} \\left( 1 - \\frac{Q(t)}{25} \\right), \\quad Q(0) = Q_0.\n$$\n\n#### Step 2: Solve the differential equation\nThe differential equation is separable. Rewrite it as:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{1 - \\frac{Q}{25}} = \\frac{r}{4} \\, dt.\n$$\nLet $ u = 1 - \\frac{Q}{25} $. Then $ du = -\\frac{1}{25} \\, dQ $, or $ dQ = -25 \\, du $. Substituting, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{-25 \\, du}{u} = \\frac{r}{4} \\, dt.\n$$\nSimplify:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u} = -\\frac{r}{100} \\, dt.\n$$\nIntegrate both sides:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{du}{u} = -\\frac{r}{100} \\int dt.\n$$\n$$\n\\ln |u| = -\\frac{r}{100} t + C,\n$$\nwhere $ C $ is the constant of integration.

This involves reflecting points $A$ across lines $BC$ and $CD$ to find the shortest path.\n   - Reflect point $A$ across line $BC$ to get point $A'$.\n   - Reflect point $A$ across line $CD$ to get point $A''$.\n\n#### 3. **Reflections:**\n   - When $A$ is reflected across $BC$, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Similarly, when $A$ is reflected across $CD$, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n   - The path $A \\to M \\to N \\to A''$ will be a straight line when the perimeter is minimized. This is because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\n\n#### 4. **Angle Calculation:**\n   - Since $A$ is reflected across $BC$ and $CD$, the angles formed by the reflections will help us determine the angles in $\\triangle AMN$.\n   - The angle $\\angle BAD = 120^\\circ$ is split into two equal angles of $60^\\circ$ each due to the reflections.\n   - The sum of the angles in $\\triangle AMN$ is $180^\\circ$. However, we need to find $\\angle AMN + \\angle ANM$.\n\n#### 5. **Using the Properties of Reflection:**\n   - The angle $\\angle AMN + \\angle ANM$ is supplementary to the angle formed by the reflections. Since the total angle around point $A$ is $360^\\circ$ and the angle $\\angle BAD = 120^\\circ$, the remaining angle is $360^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 240^\\circ$.\n   - The angle $\\angle AMN + \\angle ANM$ is half of the supplementary angle, which is $180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\n\n#### 6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sum of the angles $\\angle AMN + \\angle ANM$ is $180^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "120\u00b0", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the answer as 'B', which corresponds to 120\u00b0, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.8535174170101527, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 372}, {"name": "test_case_373", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: What is the sum of the accuracies of the algorithms calf and ivory?", "actualOutput": "To determine the sum of the accuracies of the algorithms \"calf\" and \"ivory,\" we need to read the values from the bar chart:\n\n1.

The given figure shows two triangles, $\\triangle QPR$ and $\\triangle STR$, with corresponding sides marked as equal. This indicates that the triangles are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**\n   - The triangles $\\triangle QPR$ and $\\triangle STR$ are similar because they share the same angles (as indicated by the pink angle marks).\n   - Therefore, the corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional.\n\n2. **Set Up the Proportion:**\n   - The sides of $\\triangle QPR$ are $QR$, $PR$, and $QP$.\n   - The sides of $\\triangle STR$ are $ST$, $TR$, and $SP$.\n   - From the problem, we know:\n     - $ST = 8$\n     - $TR = 4$\n     - $PT = 6$\n\n3. **Determine the Proportionality Constant:**\n   - Since $\\triangle QPR \\sim \\triangle STR$, the ratio of the corresponding sides is constant.\n   - The side $PT$ in $\\triangle STR$ corresponds to the side $PR$ in $\\triangle QPR$.\n   - The side $TR$ in $\\triangle STR$ corresponds to the side $QR$ in $\\triangle QPR$.\n\n4. **Use the Given Lengths:**\n   - We know $PT = 6$ and $TR = 4$.\n   - The ratio of the sides $PT$ to $TR$ is:\n     $$\n     \\frac{PT}{TR} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n     $$\n\n5. **Apply the Proportion to Find $QR$:**\n   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the corresponding sides $QR$ to $ST$ must be the same as the ratio of $PT$ to $TR$.\n   - Therefore:\n     $$\n     \\frac{QR}{ST} = \\frac{PT}{TR} = \\frac{3}{2}\n     $$\n   - We know $ST = 8$. Substituting this into the proportion:\n     $$\n     \\frac{QR}{8} = \\frac{3}{2}\n     $$\n\n6. **Solve for $QR$:**\n   - Cross-multiply to solve for $QR$:\n     $$\n     QR = 8 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 8 \\cdot 1.5 = 12\n     $$\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the sides. Let's recheck the proportionality with the correct sides:\n\n- The correct proportion should be based on the sides $QR$ and $ST$, and $PR$ and $TR$.\n- Given $PT = 6$ and $TR = 4$, the correct proportion should be:\n  $$\n  \\frac{QR}{ST} = \\frac{PR}{TR}\n  $$\n- Since $PT$ is part of $PR$, and $PT = 6$, we need to find the correct proportion.\n\nRe-evaluating the problem, the correct proportion should be:\n$$\n\\frac{QR}{ST} = \\frac{PR}{TR} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n$$\nThus:\n$$\nQR = 8 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 12\n$$\n\nUpon rechecking, the correct answer should

So, the sequence number for message 3 is `ISN + 50`.\n   - The sequence number for message 6 is the sequence number of message 3 plus the payload size of message 3.

The codec groups every 4 barks into a subband and then allocates bits to different subbands according to the result of a spectrum analysis based on a psychoacoustic model. All samples in the same subband are quantized with the same quantizer, and the bit resolution of which is allocated by the codec. (The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale proposed by Eberhard Zwicker in 1961.) Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of audio signal. The psychoacoustic model shown in Fig. Q1b is used in the audio codec to derive the masking threshold for the audio segment. How many potential maskers in Fig. Q1a?", "actualOutput": "To determine the number of potential maskers in Fig. Q1a, we need to understand the concept of masking in psychoacoustics. Masking refers to the phenomenon where the perception of one sound is reduced or \"masked\" by the presence of another sound. In the context of audio codecs, potential maskers are the frequency components that can mask other components.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Bark Scale**: The Bark scale is a psychoacoustical scale that represents the critical bands of human hearing. Each critical band corresponds to a range of frequencies where the human ear processes sound differently.\n2. **Subbands**: The audio signal is divided into subbands, with each subband covering a range of 4 Bark units.\n3. **Masking**: A potential masker is a frequency component that can mask other components within its subband or adjacent subbands.\n\n### Steps to Determine the Number of Potential Maskers:\n1. **Identify the Frequency Spectrum**: Fig. Q1a shows the frequency spectrum of a windowed segment of the audio signal. The spectrum is divided into critical bands (Bark units).\n2. **Group into Subbands**: Each subband covers 4 Bark units. We need to count the number of subbands in the spectrum.\n3. **Identify Maskers**: Within each subband, the most prominent frequency component (usually the one with the highest amplitude) is considered a potential masker.\n\n### Analysis:\n- From the description, we know that the audio signal is divided into subbands, with each subband covering 4 Bark units.\n- The number of potential maskers is equal to the number of subbands, as each subband has one potential masker (the most prominent frequency component).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe number of potential maskers is equal to the number of subbands.

What is the length of segment CD?", "actualOutput": "To solve for the length of segment $ CD $ in the trapezoid $ ABCD $, we will use the given information and properties of trapezoids. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n- $ AB = 24 $: This is the length of the shorter base of the trapezoid.\n- $ AD = 23 $: This is the length of one of the non-parallel sides (leg) of the trapezoid.\n- $ BC = 16 $: This is the length of the longer base of the trapezoid.\n- We need to find the length of the other non-parallel side, $ CD $.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the trapezoid\nThe trapezoid $ ABCD $ has $ AB $ and $ CD $ as the parallel sides, with $ AB $ being the shorter base and $ CD $ being the longer base. The legs $ AD $ and $ BC $ are not parallel to each other.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem\nTo find the length of $ CD $, we can drop perpendiculars from points $ A $ and $ B $ to the longer base $ CD $. Let the feet of these perpendiculars be $ P $ and $ Q $, respectively. This divides $ CD $ into three segments:\n- $ CP $: The segment from $ C $ to the foot of the perpendicular from $ A $.\n- $ PQ $: The segment between the feet of the perpendiculars.\n- $ QD $: The segment from the foot of the perpendicular from $ B $ to $ D $.\n\nSince $ AB \\parallel CD $, the length of $ PQ $ is equal to the length of $ AB $, which is 24. Therefore, we have:\n$$\nCD = CP + PQ + QD = CP + 24 + QD.\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Use the right triangles\nThe perpendiculars from $ A $ and $ B $ to $ CD $ form right triangles:\n- In $ \\triangle APD $, $ AP $ is the height of the trapezoid, and $ PD = CP + PQ = CP + 24 $.\n- In $ \\triangle BQC $, $ BQ $ is the height of the trapezoid, and $ CQ = QD + PQ = QD + 24 $.\n\nSince $ AP = BQ $ (the height of the trapezoid), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in both right triangles.\n\n#### Right triangle $ \\triangle APD $:\n- Hypotenuse: $ AD = 23 $\n- One leg: $ AP = h $ (the height of the trapezoid)\n- Other leg: $ PD = CP + 24 $\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\nAD^2 = AP^2 + PD^2 \\implies 23^2 = h^2 + (CP + 24)^2.\n$$\n\n#### Right triangle $ \\triangle BQC $:\n- Hypotenuse: $ BC = 16 $\n- One leg: $ BQ = h $ (the height of the trapezoid)\n- Other leg: $ CQ = QD + 24 $\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$\nBC^2 = BQ^2 + CQ^2 \\implies 16^2 = h^2 + (QD + 24)^2.\n$$\n\n### Step 5: Solve for $ h $ and the segments\nFrom the two equations, we have:\n1. $ 23^2 = h^2 + (CP + 24)^2 $\n2. $ 16^2 = h^2 + (QD + 24)^2 $\n\nFirst, calculate the squares:\n$$\n23^2 = 529, \\quad 16^2 = 256.\n$$\n\nSo the equations become:\n1. $ 529 = h^2 + (CP + 24)^2 $\n2. $ 256 = h^2 + (QD + 24)^2 $\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n$$\n529 - 256 = h^2 + (CP + 24)^2 - (h^2 + (QD + 24)^2).\n$$\nSimplify:\n$$\n273 = (CP + 24)^2 - (QD + 24)^2.\n$$\n\nUse the difference of squares:\n$$\n(CP + 24)^2 - (QD + 24)^2 = (CP + 24 + QD + 24)(CP + 24 - QD - 24) = (CP + QD + 48)(CP - QD).\n$$\nSo:\n$$\n273 = (CP + QD + 48)(CP - QD).\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Use the total length of $ CD $\nThe total length of $ CD $ is:\n$$\nCD = CP + PQ + QD = CP + 24 + QD.\n$$\nLet $ x = CP + QD $. Then:\n$$\nCD = x + 24.\n$$\n\nFrom the equation $ 273 = (x + 48)(CP - QD) $, we need to find $ x $. Notice that $ CP + QD = x $ and $ CP - QD $ must be an integer. By trial and error or factoring, we find:\n$$\n273 = 39 \\times 7.\n$$\nSo:\n$$\nx + 48 = 39 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CP - QD = 7.\n$$\nSolving for $ x $:\n$$\nx = 39 - 48 = -9 \\quad \\text{(not possible, so try the other factorization)}.\n$$\nTry:\n$$\nx + 48 = 7 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CP - QD = 39.\n$$\nSolving for $ x $:\n$$\nx = 7 - 48 = -41 \\quad \\text{(not possible)}.\n$$\nTry:\n$$\nx + 48 = 39 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CP - QD = 7.\n$$\nSolving for $ x $:\n$$\nx = 39 - 48 = -9 \\quad \\text{(not possible)}.\n$$\nTry:\n$$\nx + 48 = 51 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad CP - QD = 5.\n$$\nSolving for $ x $:\n$$\nx = 51 - 48 = 3.\n$$\nSo:\n$$\nCD = x + 24 = 3 + 24 = 27.\n$$\n\nThus, the length of segment $ CD $ is:\n$$\n\\boxed{31}.\n$$", "expectedOutput": "25", "context": ["free_form"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output (31) does not match the expected output (25).", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.7489035830076318, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 488}, {"name": "test_case_490", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is Dark Blue the high median?\nChoices:\n(A) yes\n(B) no", "actualOutput": "To answer this question, let's analyze the chart step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the colors and their corresponding bars:**\n   - **Medium Orchid:** The bar is fully filled and extends to the maximum value on the x-axis (50).\n   - **Royal Blue:** The bar is partially filled and extends to approximately 25 on the x-axis.\n   - **Dark Blue:** There is no bar visible for Dark Blue, indicating a value of 0.\n\n2. **Compare the values:**\n   - **Medium Orchid:** Value = 50\n   - **Royal Blue:** Value \u2248 25\n   - **Dark Blue:** Value = 0\n\n3. **Determine the median:**\n   - The median is the middle value when the values are arranged in order.\n   - Arranging the values: 0 (Dark Blue), 25 (Royal Blue), 50 (Medium Orchid).\n   - The median value is 25, which corresponds to Royal Blue.\n\n4. **Check if Dark Blue is the high median:**\n   - Dark Blue has a value of 0, which is the lowest value.\n   - Therefore, Dark Blue is not the high median.\n\n**Answer: (B) no**", "expectedOutput": "no", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies that Dark Blue is not the high median, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.632483958004741, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 490}, {"name": "test_case_489", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: \u5982\u56fe\uff0c\u70b9A\u3001C\u3001B\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u76f4\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0cDC\u22a5EC\uff0c\u82e5\u2220BCD\uff1d40\u00b0\uff0c\u5219\u2220ACE\u7684\u5ea6\u6570\u662f\uff08\uff09\nChoices:\n(A) 30\u00b0\n(B) 40\u00b0\n(C) 50\u00b0\n(D) 60\u00b0", "actualOutput": "### \u9898\u76ee\u5206\u6790\uff1a\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u51fa\u56fe\u4e2d\u2220ACE\u7684\u5ea6\u6570\u3002\u5df2\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n1. \u70b9A\u3001C\u3001B\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u76f4\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0c\u5373AB\u662f\u4e00\u6761\u76f4\u7ebf\u3002\n2.

We need to find the length of the tangent segment $ CD $.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Key Properties and Relationships:**\n   - Since $ CD $ is tangent to the circle at $ D $, the radius $ OD $ is perpendicular to the tangent $ CD $. Therefore, $ \\angle ODC = 90^\\circ $.\n   - The center $ O $ is the midpoint of the diameter $ AB $, so $ OA = OB = 2 $ (the radius of the circle).\n   - Let $ OC = x $. Then, $ AC = AO + OC = 2 + x $.\n\n2. **Use the Right Triangle $ \\triangle ODC $:**\n   - In $ \\triangle ODC $, $ OD $ is the radius of the circle, so $ OD = 2 $.\n   - $ \\angle ODC = 90^\\circ $, and $ \\angle DOC $ is the angle at the center subtended by the arc $ AD $.\n   - Since $ \\angle DAC = 30^\\circ $, and $ \\angle OAD = 90^\\circ $ (because $ AD $ is a chord and $ OA $ is a radius), we can use the fact that $ \\angle DOC = 2 \\times \\angle DAC = 2 \\times 30^\\circ = 60^\\circ $ (the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc).\n\n3. **Apply Trigonometry in $ \\triangle ODC $:**\n   - In $ \\triangle ODC $, $ \\angle DOC = 60^\\circ $, $ \\angle ODC = 90^\\circ $, and $ \\angle DCO = 30^\\circ $.\n   - Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the hypotenuse.

Instead, it would cause an increase in those populations.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **(A) herring**: Gulls prey on herring, so if gulls disappear, herring populations would likely increase, not decrease.\n- **(B) krill**: Gulls prey on krill, so if gulls disappear, krill populations would likely increase, not decrease.\n- **(C) anchovy**: Gulls prey on anchovy, so if gulls disappear, anchovy populations would likely increase, not decrease.\n- **(D) phytoplankton**: Phytoplankton is not directly preyed upon by gulls. However, since krill feed on phytoplankton, and krill populations would increase if gulls disappear, the increased krill population would likely lead to a decrease in phytoplankton due to higher consumption.\n\nThus, the organism that would potentially see a decrease if gulls disappeared is **phytoplankton**.\n\n**Answer: (D)**", "expectedOutput": "kril", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The Actual Output provides the correct answer as (D) phytoplankton, but the Expected Output specifies 'kril', which does not match the Actual Output.

The chord $ AB $ of the larger circle is tangent to the smaller circle at point $ C $. The length of the chord $ AB $ is given as 6.0. We need to find the area of the ring (the region between the two circles).\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **Tangent Property**: A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.\n2. **Chord Properties**: The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.\n3. **Area of a Circle**: The area of a circle is given by $ \\pi r^2 $, where $ r $ is the radius.\n4. **Area of the Ring**: The area of the ring is the difference between the areas of the larger and smaller circles:\n   $$\n   \\text{Area of the ring} = \\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi (R^2 - r^2)\n   $$\n   where $ R $ is the radius of the larger circle and $ r $ is the radius of the smaller circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Define the Radii:\n- Let $ R $ be the radius of the larger circle.\n- Let $ r $ be the radius of the smaller circle.\n- The center of both circles is $ O $.\n\n#### 2. Use the Tangent Property:\nSince $ AB $ is tangent to the smaller circle at point $ C $, the radius $ OC $ of the smaller circle is perpendicular to $ AB $ at $ C $. This means $ OC \\perp AB $.\n\n#### 3. Use the Chord Property:\nThe perpendicular from the center $ O $ of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, $ C $ is the midpoint of $ AB $. Given $ AB = 6.0 $, we have:\n$$\nAC = CB = \\frac{AB}{2} = \\frac{6.0}{2} = 3.0\n$$\n\n#### 4. Form a Right Triangle:\nIn the right triangle $ OCA $:\n- $ OC = r $ (radius of the smaller circle).\n- $ AC = 3.0 $ (half the length of the chord $ AB $).\n- $ OA = R $ (radius of the larger circle).\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem in $ \\triangle OCA $:\n$$\nOA^2 = OC^2 + AC^2\n$$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$$\nR^2 = r^2 + 3.0^2\n$$\n$$\nR^2 = r^2 + 9.0\n$$\n\n#### 5. Calculate the Area of the Ring:\nThe area of the ring is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Area of the ring} = \\pi R^2 - \\pi r^2 = \\pi (R^2 - r^2)\n$$\nFrom the equation $ R^2 = r^2 + 9.0 $, we have:\n$$\nR^2 - r^2 = 9.0\n$$\nThus, the area of the ring is:\n$$\n\\text{Area of the ring} = \\pi (R^2 - r^2) = \\pi \\cdot 9.0 = 9\\pi\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{A}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "9\u03c0", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the area of the ring as 9\u03c0, which matches the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.7209944170026574, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 537}, {"name": "test_case_538", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: \u5982\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u25b3ABC\u4e2d\uff0c\u70b9D\u3001E\u5206\u522b\u662f\u8fb9AB\u3001BC\u7684\u4e2d\u70b9\uff0c\u82e5\u25b3BDE\u7684\u5468\u957f\u662f6\uff0c\u5219\u25b3ABC\u7684\u5468\u957f\u662f\uff08\uff09\nChoices:\n(A) 8\n(B) 10\n(C) 12\n(D) 14", "actualOutput": "### \u9898\u76ee\u5206\u6790\uff1a\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u51fa\u25b3ABC\u7684\u5468\u957f\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u25b3BDE\u7684\u5468\u957f\u4e3a6\uff0c\u4e14\u70b9D\u548c\u70b9E\u5206\u522b\u662f\u8fb9AB\u548cBC\u7684\u4e2d\u70b9\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7ebf\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u25b3BDE\u4e0e\u25b3ABC\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\n### \u4e2d\u4f4d\u7ebf\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a\n\u5728\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u4e24\u8fb9\u4e2d\u70b9\u7684\u7ebf\u6bb5\uff08\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7ebf\uff09\u5e73\u884c\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e09\u8fb9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7b49\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e09\u8fb9\u7684\u4e00\u534a\u3002\n\n### \u89e3\u9898\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. **\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u4f4d\u7ebf**\uff1a\n   -

The triangle is rotated clockwise around point $ A $ by $ 90^\\circ $ to form $ \\triangle AB'C' $. We need to find the measure of $ \\angle AC'B' $ given that $ \\angle CC'B' = 32^\\circ $.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Rotation:**\n   - When $ \\triangle ABC $ is rotated $ 90^\\circ $ clockwise around point $ A $, the following correspondences hold:\n     - Point $ B $ maps to point $ B' $.\n     - Point $ C $ maps to point $ C' $.\n   - Since the rotation is $ 90^\\circ $, the following properties hold:\n     - $ AB = AB' $ and $ AC = AC' $ (rotation preserves distances).\n     - $ \\angle BAB' = 90^\\circ $ and $ \\angleCAC' = 90^\\circ $.\n     - The line segment $ CC' $ is the segment connecting the original point $ C $ to its image $ C' $ after rotation.\n\n2. **Properties of the Rotation:**\n   - Since $ \\triangle ABC $ is rotated $ 90^\\circ $ around $ A $, the segment $ CC' $ forms a right isosceles triangle with $ AC $ and $ AC' $, because:\n     - $ AC = AC' $ (rotation preserves lengths).\n     - $ \\angleCAC' = 90^\\circ $.\n   - Therefore, $ \\triangle ACC' $ is a right isosceles triangle, and the angle $ \\angle ACC' = \\angle AC'C = 45^\\circ $.\n\n3. **Analyzing $ \\angle CC'B' $:**\n   - We are given that $ \\angle CC'B' = 32^\\circ $.\n   - Since $ C' $ is the image of $ C $ after a $ 90^\\circ $ rotation, the line $ CC' $ is perpendicular to the line $ AB' $ (because $ \\angleCAC' = 90^\\circ $).\n   - The angle $ \\angle CC'B' $ is an exterior angle to $ \\triangle CC'B' $, and it is given as $ 32^\\circ $.\n\n4. **Finding $ \\angle AC'B' $:**\n   - In $ \\triangle CC'B' $, we know:\n     - $ \\angle CC'A = 45^\\circ $ (from the right isosceles triangle $ \\triangle ACC' $).\n     - $ \\angle CC'B' = 32^\\circ $ (given).\n   - The angle $ \\angle AC'B' $ can be found using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $ 180^\\circ $. In $ \\triangle CC'B' $, we have:\n     $$\n     \\angle AC'B' = 180^\\circ - \\angle CC'A - \\angle CC'B' = 180^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 32^\\circ = 103^\\circ.\n     $$\n   - However, we need to find the angle $ \\angle AC'B' $ in the context of the rotated triangle. Since $ \\angle CC'A = 45^\\circ $ and $ \\angle CC'B' = 32^\\circ $, the angle $ \\angle AC'B' $ is the difference between $ 45^\\circ $ and $ 32^\\circ $:\n     $$\n     \\angle AC'B' = 45^\\circ - 32^\\circ = 13^\\circ.\n     $$\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "13\u00b0", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the answer as 'C', which corresponds to 13\u00b0, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.9074511250073556, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 585}, {"name": "test_case_587", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: Which year has more actual total income?", "actualOutput": "To determine which year has more actual total income, we need to compare the \"Total Income\" values for the years 1981 and 1982 from the provided statement of operations.\n\n- **Total Income for 1981**: $735,883\n- **Total Income for 1982**: $931,441\n\nComparing these values:\n- $931,441 (1982) is greater than $735,883 (1981).\n\nTherefore, the year with more actual total income is 1982.\n\nFinal Answer: 1982", "expectedOutput": "1982", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output matches the Expected Output, both indicating '1982' as the year with more actual total income.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.6453538329806179, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 587}, {"name": "test_case_586", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: At 9.0 in the morning, a ship departs from point A and sails in the direction due east at a speed of 40.0 nautical miles per hour, and arrives at point B at 9.0 and 30.0 minutes.

For example, if $ AB = 3 $, then:\n  $$\n  CP \\leq \\frac{18}{3} = 6.\n  $$\n- If $ AB $ is close to 9, then $ CP $ must be small. For example, if $ AB = 9 $, then:\n  $$\n  CP \\leq \\frac{18}{9} = 2.\n  $$\n\nThus, the possible values of $ CP $ must satisfy:\n$$\n2 < CP < 6.\n$$\n\n### Step 6: Check the Given Options\nThe possible values of $ CP $ are between 2 and 6. Among the given options:\n- (A) 2\n- (B) 4\n- (C) 5\n- (D) 7\n- (E) 8\n\nThe only value that lies within the range $ 2 < CP < 6 $ is $ CP = 4 $.\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "2", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output provides the correct option letter 'B', but the expected output is '2', which is a numerical value.

The total area of the parallelogram is given as $S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD} = 6$. We need to find the area of the shaded region, which consists of two triangles: $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle CDE$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Properties of a Parallelogram:**\n   - In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other.\n   - The area of a parallelogram can be divided into two equal parts by any diagonal. For example, if we draw diagonal $AC$, then:\n     \\[\n     S_{\\triangle ABC} = S_{\\triangle CDA} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD}\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, if we draw diagonal $BD$, then:\n     \\[\n     S_{\\triangle ABD} = S_{\\triangle BCD} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Area Division by Point $E$:**\n   - Point $E$ is an arbitrary point inside the parallelogram. When we draw lines from $E$ to the vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, the parallelogram is divided into four triangles: $\\triangle ABE$, $\\triangle BCE$, $\\triangle CDE$, and $\\triangle ADE$.\n   - The key observation is that the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by point $E$ and the sides of the parallelogram is equal to the area of the parallelogram. Specifically:\n     \\[\n     S_{\\triangle ABE} + S_{\\triangle BCE} + S_{\\triangle CDE} + S_{\\triangle ADE} = S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD}\n     \\]\n   - Since $E$ is an arbitrary point, the areas of the triangles $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle CDE$ together will always be half of the area of the parallelogram. This is because the remaining two triangles, $\\triangle BCE$ and $\\triangle ADE$, will also together form the other half of the parallelogram.\n\n3. **Calculating the Shaded Area:**\n   - The shaded region consists of $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle CDE$. From the property mentioned above, the sum of the areas of $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle CDE$ is half the area of the parallelogram:\n     \\[\n     S_{\\triangle ABE} + S_{\\triangle CDE} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD}\n     \\]\n   - Given that $S_{\\text{quadrilateral } ABCD} = 6$, we have:\n     \\[\n     S_{\\triangle ABE} + S_{\\triangle CDE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6 = 3\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe area of the shaded part is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "3", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the shaded area as 3, which matches the Expected Output.

The conversion from degrees to radians is given by:\n  $$\n  \\text{Radians} = \\text{Degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n  $$\n- For $ 60^\\circ $:\n  $$\n  60^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n  $$\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the Arc Length\n- The formula for the arc length $ s $ is:\n  $$\n  s = r \\theta\n  $$\n  where $ r $ is the radius and $ \\theta $ is the central angle in radians.\n- Here, $ r = 5 $ and $ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} $:\n  $$\n  s = 5 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{5\\pi}{3}\n  $$\n\n#### Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices\n- The arc length $ \\widehat{WN} $ is $ \\frac{5\\pi}{3} $.\n- The correct choice is:\n  $$\n  \\boxed{B}\n  $$\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n$$\n\\boxed{B}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "\\frac { 5 } { 3 } \\pi", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output, as both indicate the correct answer is \\frac{5}{3}\\pi, corresponding to choice B.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 2.4929644170042593, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 639}, {"name": "test_case_636", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: \u5982\u56fe\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebfa\u2225b\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebfa\u4e0e\u77e9\u5f62ABCD\u7684\u8fb9AB\uff0cAD\u5206\u522b\u4ea4\u4e8e\u70b9E\uff0cF\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebfb\u4e0e\u77e9\u5f62ABCD\u7684\u8fb9CB\uff0cCD\u5206\u522b\u4ea4\u4e8e\u70b9G\uff0cH\uff0e\u82e5\u2220AFE\uff1d30\u00b0\uff0c\u5219\u2220DHG\u7684\u5ea6\u6570\u4e3a\uff08\uff09\nChoices:\n(A) 100\u00b0\n(B) 110\u00b0\n(C) 120\u00b0\n(D) 130\u00b0", "actualOutput": "### \u9898\u76ee\u5206\u6790\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u2220DHG\u7684\u5ea6\u6570\u3002\u5df2\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n1. \u76f4\u7ebf $ a \\parallel b $\u3002\n2. \u76f4\u7ebf $ a $ \u4e0e\u77e9\u5f62 $ ABCD $ \u7684\u8fb9 $ AB $ \u548c $ AD $ \u5206\u522b\u4ea4\u4e8e\u70b9 $ E $ \u548c $ F $\u3002\n3. \u76f4\u7ebf $ b $ \u4e0e\u77e9\u5f62 $ ABCD $ \u7684\u8fb9 $ CB $ \u548c $ CD $ \u5206\u522b\u4ea4\u4e8e\u70b9 $ G $ \u548c $ H $\u3002\n4. \u2220AFE = 30\u00b0\u3002\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u2220DHG\u3002\n\n---\n\n### \u89e3\u9898\u6b65\u9aa4\n\n#### \u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u884c\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\n\u7531\u4e8e $ a \\parallel b $\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5e73\u884c\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebf $ a $ \u548c $ b $ \u88ab\u76f4\u7ebf $ AD $ \u548c $ CD $ \u622a\u5f97\u7684\u540c\u4f4d\u89d2\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u2220AFE \u548c \u2220DHG \u662f\u540c\u4f4d\u89d2\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u5e73\u884c\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff1a\n$$\n\\text{\u540c\u4f4d\u89d2\u76f8\u7b49} \\implies \\angle AFE = \\angle DHG\n$$\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\uff0c\u2220DHG \u662f\u76f4\u7ebf $ b $ \u548c $ CD $ \u7684\u5939\u89d2\uff0c\u800c \u2220AFE \u662f\u76f4\u7ebf $ a $ \u548c $ AD $ \u7684\u5939\u89d2\u3002\u7531\u4e8e $ AD \\parallel CD $\uff08\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u5bf9\u8fb9\u5e73\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002\n\n#### \u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u6027\u8d28\n\u5728\u77e9\u5f62 $ ABCD $ \u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5185\u89d2\u90fd\u662f\u76f4\u89d2\uff0890\u00b0\uff09\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$ AD \\parallel CD $\uff0c\u4e14 $ AB \\parallel CD $\u3002\n\n\u7531\u4e8e $ a \\parallel b $\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebf $ a $ \u548c $ b $ \u88ab\u77e9\u5f62\u7684\u8fb9\u622a\u5f97\u7684\u540c\u4f4d\u89d2\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u2220DHG \u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n#### \u7b2c\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u2220DHG\n\u6839\u636e\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u2220AFE = 30\u00b0\u3002\u7531\u4e8e $ a \\parallel b $\uff0c\u76f4\u7ebf $ a $ \u548c $ b $ \u88ab\u76f4\u7ebf $ AD $ \u548c $ CD $ \u622a\u5f97\u7684\u540c\u4f4d\u89d2\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u2220DHG \u7684\u8865\u89d2\u7b49\u4e8e 180\u00b0 -

Let's analyze the given triangles step by step.\n\n### Triangle 1:\n- Sides: 8, 4, 2\n- Inner number: 10\n\n### Triangle 2:\n- Sides: 3, 2, 3\n- Inner number: 2\n\n### Triangle 3:\n- Sides: 12, 1, 5\n- Inner number: ?\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the pattern\nWe need to find a relationship between the sides of the triangle and the inner number. Let's test some possible patterns:\n\n#### Pattern 1: Sum of the sides\n- For Triangle 1: \\( 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\)\n- For Triangle 2: \\( 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 \\)\n\nThe inner numbers (10 and 2) do not match the sums of the sides. So, this pattern does not work.\n\n#### Pattern 2: Product of the sides\n- For Triangle 1: \\( 8 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 64 \\)\n- For Triangle 2: \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 18 \\)\n\nThe inner numbers (10 and 2) do not match the products of the sides. So, this pattern does not work either.\n\n#### Pattern 3: Sum of the sides divided by 2\n- For Triangle 1: \\( \\frac{8 + 4 + 2}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\)\n- For Triangle 2: \\( \\frac{3 + 2 + 3}{2} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 \\)\n\nThe inner numbers (10 and 2) do not match this pattern. So, this does not work.\n\n#### Pattern 4: Sum of the sides minus a constant\nLet's try subtracting a constant from the sum of the sides.\n\n- For Triangle 1: \\( 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\)\n  - If we subtract 4: \\( 14 - 4 = 10 \\) (matches the inner number)\n- For Triangle 2: \\( 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 \\)\n  - If we subtract 6: \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\) (matches the inner number)\n\nThis pattern works for both triangles. The constant subtracted seems to be related to the sides of the triangle. Let's verify:\n\n- For Triangle 1: \\( 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\)\n  - Subtract 4: \\( 14 - 4 = 10 \\)\n- For Triangle 2: \\( 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 \\)\n  - Subtract 6: \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\)\n\nThe pattern is: **Sum of the sides minus a specific constant**.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply the pattern to Triangle 3\n- Sides of Triangle 3: 12, 1, 5\n- Sum of the sides: \\( 12 + 1 + 5 = 18 \\)\n\nFrom the pattern, we need to subtract a constant. Let's determine the constant:\n- For Triangle 1: Subtract 4\n- For Triangle 2: Subtract 6\n\nThe constants seem to be related to the sides. Let's test subtracting 8 (a reasonable next step in the sequence):\n\n- For Triangle 3: \\( 18 - 8 = 10 \\)\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the result\nThe pattern holds:\n- Triangle 1: \\( 14 - 4 = 10 \\)\n- Triangle 2: \\( 8 - 6 = 2 \\)\n- Triangle 3: \\( 18 - 8 = 10 \\)\n\nThus, the missing number is **10**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "6", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The Actual Output provides the answer as 'C' (10), but the Expected Output is '6'.

A common pattern in such problems is that the central number is related to the sum or product of the surrounding numbers, possibly with some transformation (e.g., squaring).\n\n#### Hypothesis: The central number is the square of the sum of the surrounding numbers.\n- For the first square:\n  - Sum of the surrounding numbers: \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\)\n  - Square of the sum: \\(10^2 = 100\\)\n  - This matches the central number.\n\n- For the second square:\n  - Sum of the surrounding numbers: \\(3 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 14\\)\n  - Square of the sum: \\(14^2 = 196\\)\n  - This matches the central number.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the pattern to the third square\nThe third square has the following structure:\n```\n  4   6\n  ?\n  5   1\n```\n- Sum of the surrounding numbers: \\(4 + 6 + 5 + 1 = 16\\)\n- Square of the sum: \\(16^2 = 256\\)\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe missing central number is \\(\\boxed{256}\\).", "expectedOutput": "256", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the missing central number as 256, which matches the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.634814582997933, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 690}, {"name": "test_case_691", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: According to the given food chain if grasses dried up in summer, what is likely to happen?\nChoices:\n(A) Grasshoppers will decrease.\n(B) shrews will become extinct\n(C) owls will increase.\n(D) None of the above", "actualOutput": "To answer this question, let's analyze the food chain step by step:\n\n1. **Sun \u2192 Grass (Producer)**: The grass is the primary producer, which converts solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.\n2. **Grass \u2192 Grasshopper (Primary Consumer)**: The grasshopper feeds on the grass.\n3. **Grasshopper \u2192 Shrew (Secondary Consumer)**: The shrew feeds on the grasshopper.\n4. **Shrew \u2192 Owl (Tertiary Consumer)**: The owl feeds on the shrew.\n\nIf the grasses dried up in summer:\n- The primary producer (grass) would be unavailable as a food source.\n- This would directly affect the primary consumer (grasshopper), which relies on grass for food.

This means that the radius \\(OT\\) (where \\(O\\) is the center of the semicircle) is perpendicular to \\(CT\\).\n   - The center \\(O\\) of the semicircle is the midpoint of \\(AD\\), so \\(O\\) is equidistant from \\(A\\) and \\(D\\).\n\n3. **Angle Analysis:**\n   - Since \\(O\\) is the midpoint of \\(AD\\), \\(O\\) is also the center of the semicircle.

The key information provided is:\n- $FL = 24$\n- $HJ = 48$\n- $m\\widehat{HP} = 65$\n- We need to find $m\\widehat{HJ}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**\n- $FL$ and $HJ$ are chords of the circle.\n- $m\\widehat{HP} = 65$ means the measure of the arc $\\widehat{HP}$ is 65 degrees.\n- We need to find the measure of the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$.\n\n#### **Step 2: Use the property of perpendicular chords**\nFrom the diagram, we observe that:\n- Chord $FL$ is perpendicular to chord $HJ$ at point $M$ (the center of the circle).\n- When two chords are perpendicular and one of them passes through the center (which is the case here, as $HJ$ passes through $M$), the chord passing through the center is the diameter of the circle.\n\n#### **Step 3: Identify the diameter**\nSince $HJ$ passes through the center $M$, $HJ$ is the diameter of the circle. The measure of a semicircle (half of the circle) is always 180 degrees. Therefore:\n$$\nm\\widehat{HJ} = 180^\\circ\n$$\n\n#### **Step 4: Verify the given arc measure**\nWe are also given that $m\\widehat{HP} = 65$. Since $HJ$ is the diameter, the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is a semicircle, and any arc that is part of this semicircle will have a measure that is a fraction of 180 degrees. However, the problem does not require us to use $m\\widehat{HP}$ to find $m\\widehat{HJ}$, as $HJ$ is explicitly the diameter.\n\n#### **Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe measure of the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is:\n$$\nm\\widehat{HJ} = 180^\\circ\n$$\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the problem and the options provided, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.

Let's re-examine the problem with the options in mind.\n\n#### **Reinterpretation:**\nIf $HJ$ is the diameter, then the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is a semicircle, and its measure is 180 degrees. However, the options do not include 180. This suggests that the problem might be asking for a different arc or a specific segment related to the given information.\n\nGiven the options, the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the measure of a specific arc related to the given information. Since $HJ$ is the diameter, the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is a semicircle, and the measure of the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is 180 degrees. However, the options do not include 180, so we need to consider the context of the problem.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the problem, the most reasonable answer based on the options provided is:\n$$\n\\boxed{C}\n$$\n\nThis is because the problem might be asking for a specific arc related to the given information, and the measure of the arc $\\widehat{HJ}$ is 130 degrees based on the context of the problem and the options provided.", "expectedOutput": "130", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The Actual Output does not match the Expected Output.

However, the problem seems to be focusing on the relationship between the centroid and the medians. Since the centroid divides each median in the ratio \\( 2:1 \\), and we have \\( DK = 16 \\), we can use the properties of the triangle to find \\( CD \\).\n\n   The length of \\( CD \\) can be found using the fact that the centroid divides the median in the ratio \\( 2:1 \\).

The coordinates of $ A $ can be calculated using the distance $ PA = 50 $:\n\\[\nA = (50 \\cos 30^\\circ, 50 \\sin 30^\\circ)\n\\]\nUsing the values of trigonometric functions:\n\\[\n\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\quad \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\left( 50 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 50 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\left( 25\\sqrt{3}, 25 \\right)\n\\]\n\n#### Position of $ B $:\nThe ship sails from $ P $ in the direction 60\u00b0 north of west. This means the angle between the negative $ x $-axis and the direction of travel is 60\u00b0. The direction vector can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\text{Direction vector} = (\\cos 120^\\circ, \\sin 120^\\circ)\n\\]\nwhere 120\u00b0 is the angle measured counterclockwise from the positive $ x $-axis (since 60\u00b0 north of west is equivalent to 120\u00b0 from the positive $ x $-axis).\n\nThe ship travels for $ \\frac{2}{3} $ hours at a speed of 60 nautical miles per hour, so the distance traveled is:\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = 60 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 40 \\text{ nautical miles}\n\\]\nThe coordinates of $ B $ can be calculated as:\n\\[\nB = P + 40 (\\cos 120^\\circ, \\sin 120^\\circ)\n\\]\nUsing the values of trigonometric functions:\n\\[\n\\cos 120^\\circ = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\sin 120^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nB = (0, 0) + 40 \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\left( 40 \\cdot -\\frac{1}{2}, 40 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = (-20, 20\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the vectors $ \\overrightarrow{BA} $ and $ \\overrightarrow{AP} $\n#### Vector $ \\overrightarrow{BA} $:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} = A - B = \\left( 25\\sqrt{3} - (-20), 25 - 20\\sqrt{3} \\right) = \\left( 25\\sqrt{3} + 20, 25 - 20\\sqrt{3} \\right)\n\\]\n\n#### Vector $ \\overrightarrow{AP} $:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AP} = P - A = (0 - 25\\sqrt{3}, 0 - 25) = \\left( -25\\sqrt{3}, -25 \\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Use the dot product to find $ \\tan \\angle BAP $\nThe angle $ \\angle BAP $ can be found using the dot product formula:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AP} = |\\overrightarrow{BA}| |\\overrightarrow{AP}| \\cos \\angle BAP\n\\]\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent of the angle between two vectors, which can be found using the cross product:\n\\[\n\\tan \\angle BAP = \\left| \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP}}{|\\overrightarrow{BA}| |\\overrightarrow{AP}| \\cos \\angle BAP} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP}}{|\\overrightarrow{BA}| |\\overrightarrow{AP}| \\sin \\angle BAP} \\right|\n\\]\nThe cross product of two 2D vectors $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $ is given by:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP} = x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2\n\\]\nSubstituting the coordinates of $ \\overrightarrow{BA} = (25\\sqrt{3} + 20, 25 - 20\\sqrt{3}) $ and $ \\overrightarrow{AP} = (-25\\sqrt{3}, -25) $:\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP} = (25\\sqrt{3} + 20)(-25) - (25 - 20\\sqrt{3})(-25\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\\[\n= -25(25\\sqrt{3} + 20) + 25\\sqrt{3}(25 - 20\\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\\[\n= -25 \\cdot 25\\sqrt{3} - 25 \\cdot 20 + 25\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 25 - 25\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 20\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n= -625\\sqrt{3} - 500 + 625\\sqrt{3} - 1500\n\\]\n\\[\n= -500 - 1500 = -2000\n\\]\nThe magnitude of the cross product is:\n\\[\n|\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP}| = 2000\n\\]\nThe magnitudes of the vectors are:\n\\[\n|\\overrightarrow{BA}| = \\sqrt{(25\\sqrt{3} + 20)^2 + (25 - 20\\sqrt{3})^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n|\\overrightarrow{AP}| = \\sqrt{(-25\\sqrt{3})^2 + (-25)^2} = \\sqrt{1875 + 625} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50\n\\]\nUsing the formula for the tangent of the angle:\n\\[\n\\tan \\angle BAP = \\frac{|\\overrightarrow{BA} \\times \\overrightarrow{AP}|}{|\\overrightarrow{BA}| |\\overrightarrow{AP}| \\sin \\angle BAP} = \\frac{2000}{50 \\cdot 50} = \\frac{2000}{2500} = \\frac{4}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "expectedOutput": "\\frac{4}{5}", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output, as both provide the correct answer \\frac{4}{5} (or option A).", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.9412125409871805, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 841}, {"name": "test_case_842", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Is Aqua greater than Red?\nChoices:\n(A) yes\n(B) no", "actualOutput": "To answer this question, let's analyze the bar chart:\n\n1.

Properties of a Rhombus:\n- All sides of a rhombus are equal.\n- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90\u00b0).\n- The diagonals also bisect the angles of the rhombus.\n\n#### 2. Understanding the Given Information:\n- The diagonal $AC$ is given as 3. Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, the point of intersection (let's call it $O$) divides $AC$ into two equal segments:\n  $$\n  AO = OC = \\frac{AC}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5.\n  $$\n\n#### 3. Using the Angle Information:\n- The angle $\\angle BAD = 120^\\circ$. Since the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus, the diagonal $AC$ bisects $\\angle BAD$ into two equal angles:\n  $$\n  \\angle BAC = \\angle CAD = \\frac{\\angle BAD}{2} = \\frac{120^\\circ}{2} = 60^\\circ.\n  $$\n\n#### 4. Right Triangle Formation:\n- The diagonals of the rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, $\\triangle AOB$ is a right triangle with:\n  - $AO = 1.5$ (half of diagonal $AC$).\n  - $\\angle BAO = 60^\\circ$.\n  - $\\angle AOB = 90^\\circ$.\n\n#### 5. Using Trigonometry to Find the Side Length:\n- In $\\triangle AOB$, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1 : \\sqrt{3} : 2$. Here:\n  - $AO$ (opposite the 30\u00b0 angle) is $1.5$.\n  - $AB$ (the hypotenuse) can be found using the relationship in a 30-60-90 triangle:\n    $$\n    AB = 2 \\times AO = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3.\n    $$\n\n#### 6. Perimeter of the Rhombus:\n- Since all sides of the rhombus are equal, each side is $AB = 3$.\n- The perimeter of the rhombus is:\n  $$\n  \\text{Perimeter} = 4 \\times AB = 4 \\times 3 = 12.\n  $$\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{D}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "12", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies the perimeter of the rhombus as 12, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.620372999983374, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 852}, {"name": "test_case_853", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: If the pelicans in the community were eradicated, which population feel the most direct effect?\nChoices:\n(A) Plant\n(B) Phyto-plankton\n(C) Fish\n(D) Lizard", "actualOutput": "To determine which population would feel the most direct effect if the pelicans in the community were eradicated, we need to analyze the food chain depicted in the image.\n\n1. **Pelican's Position in the Food Chain**:\n   - The pelican is shown as a **tertiary consumer (secondary carnivore)** in the aquatic food chain.\n   - It preys on fish.\n\n2. **Direct Effect**:\n   - If the pelicans were eradicated, the population that would be most directly affected is the one that the pelicans prey on.\n   - In this case, the pelicans prey on **fish**.\n\n3. **Indirect Effects**:\n   - The eradication of pelicans would lead to an increase in the fish population because there would be fewer predators.\n   - This increase in fish could then affect the population of zooplankton, which are preyed upon by fish.\n   - However, the most direct effect would be on the fish population.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the population that would feel the most direct effect if the pelicans were eradicated is the **fish** population.\n\n**Answer: (C) Fish**", "expectedOutput": "Fish", "context": ["multi_choice"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The Actual Output correctly identifies 'Fish' as the population most directly affected, matching the Expected Output.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.3766289580089506, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 853}, {"name": "test_case_855", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Which picture has the least leaves?\nChoices:\n(A) Both\n(B) Compound\n(C) Simple\n(D) Neither", "actualOutput": "To determine which picture has the least leaves, let's analyze the images:\n\n1.

The horizontal distance $ D $ can be expressed as:\n$$\nD = v_0 \\cos \\theta_0 \\cdot t\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $ v_0 $:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{D}{t \\cos \\theta_0}\n$$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{20.0}{2.50 \\cdot \\cos 40.0^\\circ}\n$$\n\nFirst, calculate $ \\cos 40.0^\\circ $:\n$$\n\\cos 40.0^\\circ \\approx 0.766\n$$\n\nNow, substitute this value:\n$$\nv_0 = \\frac{20.0}{2.50 \\cdot 0.766} = \\frac{20.0}{1.915} \\approx 10.44 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nSo, the magnitude of the velocity at launch is:\n$$\nv_0 \\approx 10.44 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Vertical Motion\nThe vertical component of the velocity at launch is:\n$$\nv_{0y} = v_0 \\sin \\theta_0\n$$\n\nSubstitute the values:\n$$\nv_{0y} = 10.44 \\cdot \\sin 40.0^\\circ\n$$\n\nFirst, calculate $ \\sin 40.0^\\circ $:\n$$\n\\sin 40.0^\\circ \\approx 0.643\n$$\n\nNow, substitute this value:\n$$\nv_{0y} = 10.44 \\cdot 0.643 \\approx 6.71 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nThe vertical velocity at landing can be found using the equation:\n$$\nv_{y} = v_{0y} - g t\n$$\n\nSubstitute the values:\n$$\nv_{y} = 6.71 - 9.80 \\cdot 2.50\n$$\n$$\nv_{y} = 6.71 - 24.50 = -17.79 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the velocity is downward.\n\n### Step 4: Magnitude of Velocity at Landing\nThe magnitude of the velocity at landing is the resultant of the horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component remains the same:\n$$\nv_x = v_0 \\cos \\theta_0 = 10.44 \\cdot 0.766 \\approx 8.00 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity at landing is:\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}\n$$\n\nSubstitute the values:\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{(8.00)^2 + (-17.79)^2}\n$$\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{64.00 + 316.48}\n$$\n$$\nv = \\sqrt{380.48} \\approx 19.51 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\n### Final Answers\nThe magnitude of the velocity at launch is:\n$$\n\\boxed{10.44}\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity at landing is:\n$$\n\\boxed{19.51}\n$$", "expectedOutput": "10.44", "context": ["free_form"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output of 10.44 for the magnitude of the velocity at launch.", "strictMode": true, "evaluationModel": "qwen2_5 (Local Model)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Check if the answer in actual_output is match with the answer in expected output, note that for multiple choice problems, e.g. (A) Yes, (B) No, answer using either the letter (e.g. A) or the content (e.g. Yes) can both considered correct if it match the intended answer\",\n    \"if it is, give it full scores, if not, 0 points\",\n    \"You do not have to concern about the explanation, only looking at final results is fine\"\n]"}], "runDuration": 1.8613508330017794, "evaluationCost": 0.0, "order": 861}, {"name": "test_case_862", "input": "Hint: Please answer the question and provide the correct option letter, e.g., A, B, C, D, at the end.\nQuestion: Does Rhode Island have the lowest value in the USA ?\nChoices:\n(A) Yes\n(B) No", "actualOutput": "To determine if Rhode Island has the lowest value in the USA based on the map, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Color Scale**: The map uses a color gradient to represent the percentage of services.

We need to find the measure of \\( \\angle BAD \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Key Properties:**\n   - Since \\( AB \\) is the diameter of the circle, \\( \\angle ACB \\) is a right angle (i.e., \\( \\angle ACB = 90^\\circ \\)). This is a direct consequence of the **Thales' Theorem**, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.\n\n2. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**\n   - The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Additionally, inscribed angles that subtend the same arc are equal.\n\n3. **Analyze \\( \\angle ACD \\):**\n   - \\( \\angle ACD \\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \\( AD \\). Therefore, the measure of \\( \\angle ACD \\) is equal to the measure of any other inscribed angle that subtends the same arc \\( AD \\).\n\n4. **Relate \\( \\angle ACD \\) to \\( \\angle BAD \\):**\n   - Since \\( \\angle ACD \\) and \\( \\angle BAD \\) both subtend the same arc \\( AD \\), they are equal.

Let's examine the differences or transformations between consecutive terms.\n\n#### From 3968 to 63:\n- Notice that 3968 is a large number, and 63 is much smaller. This suggests a significant reduction or transformation.\n- Upon closer inspection, 3968 can be expressed as \\( 8^4 \\) (since \\( 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 4096 \\), and 3968 is close but not exact, but we'll explore this further).\n\n#### From 63 to 8:\n- The number 63 is reduced to 8.

This suggests another transformation.\n- Notice that \\( 8 \\approx 3^2 \\) (since \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\), which is close to 8).\n\n### Step 2: Hypothesize the pattern\nFrom the above observations, it appears that each number is being transformed by taking the square root (or a similar operation) and rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n#### Verify the pattern:\n1. Start with 3968:\n   - \\( \\sqrt{3968} \\approx 63 \\) (since \\( 63^2 = 3969 \\)).\n\n2. From 63:\n   - \\( \\sqrt{63} \\approx 8 \\) (since \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)).\n\n3.
