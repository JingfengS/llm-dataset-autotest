Let's first calculate the pressure at the ground level. We know that the pressure at 5 m below ground level is 600 kPa, and the pressure decreases by 100 kPa for every 10 m increase in height. Therefore, the pressure at the ground level is 600 kPa - 50 kPa = 550 kPa. Next, we calculate the pressure at the top floor, which is 100 m above the ground level. The pressure at the top floor is 550 kPa - 100 kPa = 450 kPa. The pump work is the difference between the pressure at the ground level and the pressure at the top floor, multiplied by the flow rate. Therefore, the pump work is (550 kPa - 450 kPa) * 10 kg/s = 1000 kPa * 10 kg/s = 10,000 kPa * kg/s = 10,000 N * m/s = 10,000 W = 10 MW.
