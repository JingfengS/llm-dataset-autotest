Canker can affect a wide range of tree species and is often difficult to treat once it has spread.\n\n### Treatment of Canker\nTreating canker can be challenging, but there are several steps you can take to manage and potentially control the disease:\n\n1. **Prune Affected Branches**: Remove any branches that show signs of canker. Prune back to healthy wood, ensuring that the cut is made just outside the cankered area.\n\n2. **Sanitize Pruning Tools**: Use clean, sanitized pruning tools to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the tree or to other trees.\n\n3. **Apply Fungicide**: In some cases, applying a fungicide to the affected area can help control the spread of the disease. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\n\n4. **Improve Tree Health**: Ensure the tree is well-watered and fertilized to improve its overall health and resistance to disease.\n\n5. **Monitor for Spread**: Regularly inspect the tree for signs of new canker lesions and treat them promptly.\n\n6. **Consult a Professional**: If the canker is severe or widespread, it may be necessary to consult a professional arborist or plant pathologist for more specialized treatment.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can help manage canker and potentially save your tree from further damage.", "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits.

When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5.

Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad or neem oil, which are effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.\n   - Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of leaf miner populations in the soil.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to physically prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control leaf miner damage in your plants.", "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5.

Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools.

Brown Spot is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and shape. These spots often have a darker border and can cause the leaves to become discolored, wilted, or even fall off.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot\nBrown Spot is caused by various fungi, including Alternaria, Cercospora, and Septoria species. These fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions and can spread quickly through water droplets, wind, or contact with infected plants. The disease can weaken plants, reduce their growth, and affect their overall health.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Spot\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Do not compost infected plant material, as the fungus can survive in the compost.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Avoid Overwatering**: Water plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, as it can spread the fungus.\n\n4. **Use Fungicides**: Apply a fungicide labeled for Brown Spot control. Copper-based fungicides, mancozeb, and chlorothalonil are commonly used. Follow the instructions on the label carefully.\n\n5. **Plant Resistant Varieties**: If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot.\n\n6. **Clean Tools and Equipment**: Sanitize pruning tools and other gardening equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n7. **Practice Crop Rotation**: If the disease affects vegetables, practice crop rotation to avoid planting susceptible crops in the same location for several years.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Brown Spot, helping to keep your plants healthy and thriving.", "expectedOutput": "It is early blight.

Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather.
