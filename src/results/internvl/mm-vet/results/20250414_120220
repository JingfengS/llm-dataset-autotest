(These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants.

It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8.

Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers.

It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years.

There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often seen in infections or inflammatory conditions. The image does not show any clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass would appear as a well-defined opacity.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax in this image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: This condition is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. The image does not show any clear signs of consolidation.\n\n10. **Edema**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium, leading to increased opacity and a \"bat wing\" pattern.

The image does not show any clear signs of emphysema.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: This condition involves the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, leading to increased opacity and reticular patterns. The image does not show any clear signs of fibrosis.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition involves the thickening of the pleura, which would appear as a linear or nodular opacity along the pleural surface.

apricots, cherries, peaches and plums. It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8.

Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.\n\nStep 2\n    Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\n\nStep 3\n    To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.\n\nStep 4\n    Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nStep 5\n    Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall.

Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft.

It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6.

It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall.

Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6.

The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which would appear as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often seen in infections or inflammatory conditions. The image does not show any clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass would appear as a well-defined opacity. There are no obvious masses in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round opacity. There are no visible nodules in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: This condition is characterized by consolidation of lung tissue, often with air bronchograms. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia in this image.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition involves the presence of air in the pleural space, which would cause the lung to collapse and appear as a visible line of the visceral pleura. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in this image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: This condition is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. There is no clear evidence of consolidation in this image.\n\n10. **Edema**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium, leading to increased opacity and often a \"bat wing\" pattern. There is no clear evidence of edema in this image.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: This condition involves the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to hyperinflation and increased radiolucency. There is no clear evidence of emphysema in this image.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: This condition involves the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, leading to increased opacity and reticular patterns. There is no clear evidence of fibrosis in this image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition involves the thickening of the pleura, which would appear as a linear or nodular opacity along the pleural surface. There is no clear evidence of pleural thickening in this image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: This condition involves the protrusion of an organ through an abnormal opening.

As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does.

It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7.

Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts.

Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4.

In the image, there is a noticeable area of increased opacity in the left lower lung zone, suggesting the presence of atelectasis.\n\n2. **Cardiomegaly**: This condition involves an enlarged heart. The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung base. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This refers to the presence of abnormal material (such as fluid, cells, or other substances) in the lung parenchyma, often seen as diffuse or patchy opacities. The image does not show clear signs of diffuse infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There is no distinct mass visible in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. No nodules are evident in this image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically presents as localized areas of consolidation or infiltrates. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could be indicative of pneumonia, but further clinical correlation is needed.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition involves air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in this image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation appears as a dense, homogenous opacity in the lung fields. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could represent consolidation, possibly due to pneumonia or atelectasis.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema presents as diffuse bilateral opacities, often with a butterfly pattern. This image does not show such a pattern.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: Emphysema is characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs and increased radiolucency. The image does not show signs of hyperinflation or increased radiolucency.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Fibrosis typically presents as reticular or honeycombing patterns. There are no such patterns visible in this image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition involves thickening of the pleura, which can be seen as linear opacities along the chest wall. No pleural thickening is evident in this image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia would typically show as an abnormal bulging or displacement of structures. There is no evidence of a hernia in this image.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most likely conditions present in this chest X-ray are **atelectasis** and **consolidation**. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone suggests these conditions, which could be due to pneumonia or another cause of atelectasis.

(These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7.

The image shows some increased opacity in the left lower lung zone, which could suggest atelectasis.\n\n2. **Cardiomegaly**: This condition is characterized by an enlarged heart. The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which would appear as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often seen in infections or inflammatory conditions. The image does not show any clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass would appear as a well-defined opacity. There are no obvious masses in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round opacity. There are no visible nodules in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: This condition is characterized by consolidation of lung tissue, often with air bronchograms. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia in this image.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition involves the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in this image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: This condition is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. There is no clear evidence of consolidation in this image.\n\n10. **Edema**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium, leading to increased opacity and often a \"bat wing\" pattern. There is no clear evidence of edema in this image.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: This condition involves the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to hyperinflation and increased radiolucency. There is no clear evidence of emphysema in this image.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: This condition involves the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, leading to increased opacity and reticular patterns. There is no clear evidence of fibrosis in this image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition involves the thickening of the pleura, which would appear as a linear or nodular opacity along the pleural surface. There is no clear evidence of pleural thickening in this image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: This condition involves the protrusion of an organ through an abnormal opening.

The railway, built in 1909, played a crucial role in connecting the village to other areas, contributing to its growth.\n\nThe most substantial development occurred between 1922 and 1970, with the village expanding extensively. This era witnessed the construction of the motorway in 1970, which further enhanced connectivity and likely spurred additional growth.

Agriculture has consistently been the largest consumer of water, with usage increasing from around 500 km\u00b3 in 1900 to over 3,000 km\u00b3 by 2000. Industrial use has also seen a significant rise, starting at nearly 0 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching approximately 1,000 km\u00b3 by 2000. Domestic use, while the smallest sector, has steadily increased from a negligible amount in 1900 to about 500 km\u00b3 by 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of just 8 m\u00b3.

We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively.

The image does not show any obvious signs of atelectasis, such as increased opacity or volume loss in a specific lung region.\n\n2. **Cardiomegaly**: This condition is characterized by an enlarged heart. The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no visible fluid level or homogenous opacity in the costophrenic angles, making effusion unlikely.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung parenchyma, often seen as diffuse haziness. The lung fields in the image appear clear without any diffuse haziness, so infiltration is unlikely.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There are no visible masses in the lung fields.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. There are no visible nodules in the lung fields.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically presents as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. The lung fields appear clear without any localized opacities, making pneumonia unlikely.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax, such as a visible visceral pleural line with absent lung markings peripheral to it.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. The lung fields appear clear without any areas of consolidation.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lung interstitium and alveoli, often presenting as bilateral, fluffy opacities. The lung fields appear clear without any signs of edema.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: Emphysema is characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs, increased radiolucency, and flattened diaphragms. The lung fields do not show signs of hyperinflation or increased radiolucency, making emphysema unlikely.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by interstitial thickening and reticular opacities. The lung fields appear clear without any signs of fibrosis.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleura, which can be seen as linear or nodular opacities along the pleural surface. There is no visible pleural thickening in the image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia, such as a diaphragmatic hernia, would typically show bowel loops or other abdominal contents in the thoracic cavity. There is no visible evidence of a hernia in the image.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the provided chest X-ray image, none of the listed conditions (Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Effusion, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Pleural Thickening, Hernia) are evident.

A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7.

It can be triggered by factors such as drought, mechanical damage, insect infestations, or fungal infections. The sap exudation is a tree's natural response to injury or stress.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Identify the Cause**: Determine if the gummosis is due to pests, disease, or environmental stress.\n2. **Prune Damaged Areas**: Remove any dead or damaged branches to prevent further infection.\n3. **Improve Care**: Ensure the tree receives adequate water and nutrients. Mulching can help retain moisture.\n4. **Pest Control**: If pests are the cause, use appropriate insecticides or biological controls.\n5. **Fungicide Application**: If a fungal infection is present, apply a suitable fungicide as recommended.\n6. **Avoid Mechanical Injury**: Protect the tree from physical damage by vehicles, lawn equipment, etc.\n\nRegular monitoring and proper tree care can help manage and prevent gummosis.", "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more.

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\".

The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount.

Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water.

The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung base. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung parenchyma, often seen as diffuse or patchy opacities. The image does not show clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There is no distinct mass visible in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. There are no visible nodules in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically presents as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could be indicative of pneumonia.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in the image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could be indicative of consolidation.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lung interstitium and alveoli, often presenting as bilateral, fluffy opacities. The image does not show clear signs of edema.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: This condition is characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to hyperinflation and increased radiolucency. The image does not show clear signs of emphysema.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, often presenting as reticular opacities. The image does not show clear signs of fibrosis.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleural lining, often seen as linear or nodular opacities along the pleura. The image does not show clear signs of pleural thickening.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia in the chest X-ray would typically present as an abnormal bulging of structures.

The image does not show any obvious signs of atelectasis, such as increased opacity or volume loss in a specific lung region.\n\n2. **Cardiomegaly**: This condition is characterized by an enlarged heart. The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no evidence of fluid accumulation in the pleural spaces in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often appearing as diffuse haziness. The image does not show any diffuse haziness that would suggest infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There are no distinct, well-defined masses visible in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. There are no small, round opacities visible in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically appears as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. There are no localized areas of increased opacity that would suggest pneumonia.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, which can cause the lung to collapse. There are no signs of pneumothorax, such as a visible pleural line or absence of lung markings.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation appears as a dense, homogenous opacity in the lung fields. There are no areas of consolidation visible in the image.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema appears as diffuse haziness or Kerley B lines. The image does not show any signs of diffuse haziness or Kerley B lines.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: Emphysema is characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs, increased radiolucency, and flattened diaphragms. The image does not show signs of hyperinflation or increased radiolucency.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Pulmonary fibrosis typically appears as reticular or honeycombing patterns. There are no such patterns visible in the image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleural lining, which can be seen as linear or nodular opacities along the pleura. There are no signs of pleural thickening in the image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia, such as a diaphragmatic hernia, would typically show bowel loops or other abdominal contents in the thoracic cavity. There are no signs of a hernia in the image.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the provided chest X-ray image, none of the listed conditions (Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Effusion, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Pleural Thickening, Hernia) are evident.

Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water.

These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested.

Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6.

Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.", "context": ["rec", "know", "gen", "copy_3"], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The actual output does not match the expected output.

These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2.

This ooze can appear slimy and may have a foul odor.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Prevention**: Ensure proper tree care, including adequate watering, mulching, and avoiding mechanical injuries to the tree.\n\n2. **Drainage**: In some cases, installing a drainage pipe can help relieve pressure and reduce ooze.\n\n3. **Avoid Sealing**: Do not seal the wounds, as this can trap moisture and worsen the condition.\n\n4. **Sanitation**: Keep the area around the tree clean to reduce the risk of infection spreading.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**: For severe cases, consulting an arborist can provide tailored advice and treatment options.\n\nRegular monitoring and maintaining tree health are key to managing wetwood.", "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9.

As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems.

Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil.

Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden.

Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5.

Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts.

There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often seen in infections or inflammatory conditions. The image does not show any clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass would appear as a well-defined opacity.

There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in this image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: This condition is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. There is no clear evidence of consolidation in this image.\n\n10. **Edema**: This condition involves the accumulation of fluid in the lung interstitium, leading to increased opacity and often a \"bat wing\" pattern. There is no clear evidence of edema in this image.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: This condition involves the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to hyperinflation and increased radiolucency. There is no clear evidence of emphysema in this image.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: This condition involves the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, leading to increased opacity and reticular patterns. There is no clear evidence of fibrosis in this image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition involves the thickening of the pleura, which would appear as a linear or nodular opacity along the pleural surface. There is no clear evidence of pleural thickening in this image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: This condition involves the protrusion of an organ through an abnormal opening.

It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants.

The railway, built in 1909, played a crucial role in connecting the village to other areas, contributing to its growth.\n\nThe most substantial development occurred between 1922 and 1970, with the village expanding extensively. This period witnessed the construction of the motorway in 1970, which further enhanced connectivity and likely spurred additional growth. The motorway's presence indicates a shift towards accommodating increased vehicular traffic.\n\nBy 1994, the village had expanded to its current size, with the addition of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which added recreational facilities to the area.

A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7.

As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.", "context": ["rec", "know", "gen", "copy_1"], "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Correctness (GEval)", "threshold": 1.0, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The actual output matches the expected output in terms of the painting's title, artist, creation period, and main subject matter.

Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7.

Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts.

Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water.

(These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6.

The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung base. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung parenchyma, often seen as diffuse or patchy opacities. The image does not show clear signs of infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There is no distinct mass visible in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. There are no visible nodules in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically presents as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could be indicative of pneumonia.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in the image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation is characterized by the filling of alveolar spaces with fluid, pus, blood, or cells, leading to increased opacity. The increased opacity in the left lower lung zone could be indicative of consolidation.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema is characterized by fluid accumulation in the lung interstitium and alveoli, often presenting as bilateral, fluffy opacities. The image does not show clear signs of edema.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: This condition is characterized by the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to hyperinflation and increased radiolucency. The image does not show clear signs of emphysema.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the thickening and scarring of lung tissue, often presenting as reticular opacities. The image does not show clear signs of fibrosis.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleural lining, often seen as linear or nodular opacities along the pleura. The image does not show clear signs of pleural thickening.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia, such as a diaphragmatic hernia, would typically show displacement of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity.

Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant.

It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants.

Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does.

Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections.

The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which usually appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no clear evidence of pleural effusion in this image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often appearing as diffuse haziness. The image does not show clear signs of diffuse infiltration.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass is a well-defined area of increased opacity. There are no distinct masses visible in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round or oval-shaped opacity. There are no visible nodules in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically appears as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. The image does not show clear signs of pneumonia.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, leading to lung collapse. There is no visible evidence of pneumothorax in the image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation appears as a dense, homogenous opacity in the lung fields. The image does not show clear signs of consolidation.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema appears as diffuse haziness or Kerley B lines. The image does not show clear signs of edema.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: Emphysema is characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs and increased radiolucency. The image does not show clear signs of emphysema.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Fibrosis appears as reticular or honeycombing patterns. The image does not show clear signs of fibrosis.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleura, which can be seen as linear or nodular opacities along the pleural surface. There is no visible evidence of pleural thickening in the image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia would typically show displacement of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity. There is no visible evidence of a hernia in the image.\n\n**Conclusion**: The most likely condition present in the image is **Atelectasis**, as evidenced by the increased opacity in the lower lung zones.

The heart size in the image appears to be within normal limits, so cardiomegaly is unlikely.\n\n3. **Effusion**: Pleural effusion is characterized by fluid accumulation in the pleural space, which typically appears as a homogenous opacity at the lung bases. There is no evidence of such opacities in the image.\n\n4. **Infiltration**: This condition is characterized by the spread of a substance (such as fluid, cells, or other material) into the lung tissue, often appearing as diffuse haziness. The image does not show any diffuse haziness.\n\n5. **Mass**: A mass would appear as a well-defined opacity. There are no such opacities present in the image.\n\n6. **Nodule**: A nodule is a small, round opacity. There are no small, round opacities visible in the image.\n\n7. **Pneumonia**: Pneumonia typically appears as localized areas of increased opacity due to consolidation of lung tissue. There are no such localized opacities in the image.\n\n8. **Pneumothorax**: This condition is characterized by the presence of air in the pleural space, which would appear as a visible visceral pleural line with no lung markings peripheral to it. There is no evidence of such a line in the image.\n\n9. **Consolidation**: Consolidation appears as a dense, homogenous opacity in the lung fields. There are no such opacities in the image.\n\n10. **Edema**: Pulmonary edema typically appears as bilateral, fluffy opacities. The image does not show such opacities.\n\n11. **Emphysema**: Emphysema is characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs, increased radiolucency, and flattened diaphragms. The image does not show these features.\n\n12. **Fibrosis**: Fibrosis would appear as reticular or honeycombing patterns. There are no such patterns in the image.\n\n13. **Pleural Thickening**: This condition is characterized by thickening of the pleural lining, which would appear as a linear opacity along the pleural surface. There is no evidence of such opacities in the image.\n\n14. **Hernia**: A hernia would appear as an abnormal bulging of structures through an opening. There is no evidence of such a bulging in the image.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the provided chest X-ray image, none of the listed conditions (Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Effusion, Infiltration, Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Pneumothorax, Consolidation, Edema, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Pleural Thickening, Hernia) are evident.

The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6.

It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water.

Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7.
