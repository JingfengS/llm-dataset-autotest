These lesions can lead to the death of branches or even the entire tree if left untreated.\n\n### Introduction to Canker Disease:\nCanker disease is caused by various fungi and bacteria that infect the bark and cambium layer of trees. It can be spread through wounds, insect damage, or poor pruning practices. The disease weakens the tree, making it susceptible to further infections and environmental stresses.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Resin or sap oozing from the bark\n- Sunken or raised lesions on the bark\n- Cracks or splits in the bark\n- Dieback of branches\n- Discoloration of leaves\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Prune Affected Branches:**\n   - Remove and dispose of infected branches to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Use clean, sharp pruning tools and disinfect them between cuts.\n\n2. **Apply Fungicide:**\n   - Use a suitable fungicide to treat the affected areas. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\n   - Apply the fungicide to the lesions and surrounding bark.\n\n3. **Improve Tree Health:**\n   - Ensure the tree is well-watered and fertilized to boost its immune system.\n   - Provide adequate sunlight and air circulation around the tree.\n\n4. **Preventative Measures:**\n   - Avoid wounding the tree bark.\n   - Practice proper pruning techniques.\n   - Keep the area around the tree clean and free of debris.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional:**\n   - If the disease is severe or widespread, consult a certified arborist or plant pathologist for expert advice and treatment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage and control canker disease, preserving the health and longevity of your tree.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.",

Here is a general recipe to make a similar strawberry pie:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **For the Crust:**\n  - 2 cups all-purpose flour\n  - 1/2 teaspoon salt\n  - 3/4 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed\n  - 1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water\n\n- **For the Filling:**\n  - 4 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced\n  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n  - 1/4 cup cornstarch\n  - 1/4 teaspoon salt\n  - 1/4 teaspoon almond extract\n  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Crust:**\n   - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\n   - Add the cold butter and use a pastry blender or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n   - Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix until the dough comes together. Do not overmix.\n   - Divide the dough into two discs, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a large bowl, mix together the sliced strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and almond extract.\n\n3. **Assemble the Pie:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n   - Roll out one disc of dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Transfer it to the dish and trim the edges, leaving about 1/2 inch overhang.\n   - Pour the strawberry mixture into the pie crust.\n   - Roll out the second disc of dough and cut it into strips to create a lattice top. Lay the strips over the filling, weaving them over and under each other.\n   - Trim the edges of the strips and fold the overhanging bottom crust over the top crust to seal. Crimp the edges for a decorative finish.\n\n4. **Bake the Pie:**\n   - Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips.\n   - Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake for an additional 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.\n   - If the crust starts to brown too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil.\n\n5. **Cool and Serve:**\n   - Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade strawberry pie with a lattice crust!",

Gray mold typically appears as a gray, fuzzy growth on the fruit, often accompanied by a musty smell. It can spread quickly, especially in damp and humid conditions.\n\n### How to Treat Gray Mold:\n\n1. **Remove Infected Fruits:**\n   - Carefully remove and dispose of any infected strawberries to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n2. **Prune Affected Areas:**\n   - Prune any infected leaves or stems to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n\n3. **Improve Air Circulation:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity levels.\n\n4. **Avoid Overwatering:**\n   - Water plants in the morning to allow them to dry out before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can increase humidity around the plants.\n\n5. **Apply Fungicides:**\n   - Use a fungicide labeled for use on strawberries. Follow the instructions carefully, and apply it as directed.\n\n6. **Maintain Cleanliness:**\n   - Keep the area around the plants clean and free of debris, which can harbor the fungus.\n\n7. **Use Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Consider planting strawberry varieties that are resistant to gray mold.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help control and prevent the spread of gray mold in your strawberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

Apple scab is a common and destructive disease that affects apples and pears, causing brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. It can significantly reduce the quality and yield of the crop.\n\n### Introduction to Apple Scab:\n- **Symptoms**: Brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit.\n- **Impact**: Reduces crop quality and yield.\n- **Favorable Conditions**: Moist and cool weather.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention:\n1. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Pruning**: Remove infected branches and leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n   - **Sanitation**: Clean up and dispose of infected plant debris to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus.\n   - **Planting Resistant Varieties**: Choose apple varieties that are resistant to apple scab.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Fungicides**: Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or copper-based products. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n   - **Timing**: Apply fungicides before and during the flowering period, and continue applications at regular intervals throughout the growing season.\n\n3. **Biological Control**:\n   - **Beneficial Microbes**: Use beneficial fungi or bacteria that can compete with Venturia inaequalis for space and nutrients.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - **Monitor**: Regularly check plants for signs of infection.\n   - **Thresholds**: Apply treatments only when necessary, based on disease pressure and weather conditions.\n\n### Prevention:\n- **Proper Planting**: Ensure good air circulation around plants to reduce humidity.\n- **Irrigation Management**: Avoid overhead watering, which can increase humidity and promote fungal growth.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage and control apple scab, protecting your apple trees and ensuring a healthy yield.",
      "expectedOutput": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.",

In 1900, agricultural water use was around 500 km\u00b3, which rose to approximately 2,500 km\u00b3 by 2000. Industrial water use also saw a substantial increase, starting at around 100 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching about 1,000 km\u00b3 in 2000. Domestic water use, while the smallest sector, also showed a steady increase from around 50 km\u00b3 in 1900 to about 500 km\u00b3 in 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 8 m\u00b3. This indicates a much higher water consumption per person in Brazil compared to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows a significant increase in global water use across all sectors, with agriculture being the largest consumer. The table highlights the disparity in water consumption between Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with Brazil having a much higher water consumption per person.",

We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m\u00b3, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m\u00b3, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.",

It affects corn plants by forming galls or swellings on various parts of the plant, including the ears, leaves, and stalks. These galls are initially white but turn brown and eventually release a powdery, black spore mass.\n\n### Introduction to Corn Smut\nCorn smut is a serious disease that can significantly reduce corn yields. The fungus infects the plant through wounds or natural openings, and the galls it forms can be quite large, sometimes reaching the size of a human fist. The disease is more common in areas with high humidity and warm temperatures.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Remove and Destroy Infected Plants:** Remove and destroy infected plants as soon as they are noticed to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting corn in the same field for several years in a row, as the fungus can survive in the soil.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially in areas with a history of corn smut. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - **Plant Resistant Corn Varieties:** Use corn varieties that are resistant to corn smut. Consult with local agricultural extension services or seed suppliers for recommendations.\n\n4. **Sanitation:**\n   - **Clean Farming Practices:** Keep the field clean by removing crop residue after harvest to reduce the amount of fungal spores in the soil.\n\n5. **Monitor and Inspect:**\n   - **Regular Inspections:** Regularly inspect corn plants for signs of smut, especially during the growing season.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control corn smut, reducing its impact on your corn crop.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

Gray mold typically appears as a gray, fuzzy growth on the fruit, often accompanied by a musty smell. It can spread quickly, especially in damp and humid conditions.\n\n### How to Treat Gray Mold:\n\n1. **Remove Infected Fruits:**\n   - Carefully remove and dispose of any infected strawberries to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n2. **Prune Affected Areas:**\n   - Prune any infected leaves or stems to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n\n3. **Improve Air Circulation:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity levels.\n\n4. **Avoid Overwatering:**\n   - Water plants in the morning to allow them to dry out before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can increase humidity around the plants.\n\n5. **Apply Fungicides:**\n   - Use a fungicide labeled for use on strawberries. Follow the instructions carefully, and apply it as directed.\n\n6. **Use Organic Controls:**\n   - Consider using organic fungicides such as copper or sulfur-based products.\n\n7. **Plant Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Choose strawberry varieties that are resistant to gray mold.\n\n8. **Sanitize Tools and Equipment:**\n   - Clean and sanitize all gardening tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help control and prevent the spread of gray mold in your strawberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

If I like this, then you will. This is very authentic because my family is Chinese and I am too. This recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.\n\n\nPrep Time:\n1 hr\nCook Time:\n30 mins\nAdditional Time:\n1 hr\nTotal Time:\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServings:\n20\nYield:\n20 egg rolls\n\n\n Ingredients\n\n    4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided\n\n    3 large eggs, beaten\n\n    1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded\n\n    \u00bd carrot, julienned\n\n    1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks\n\n    1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots\n\n    1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated\n\n    2 green onions, thinly sliced\n\n    2 \u00bd teaspoons soy sauce\n\n    1 teaspoon salt\n\n    1 teaspoon sugar\n\n    \u00bd teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)\n\n    1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers\n\n    1 egg white, beaten\n\n    4 cups oil for frying, or as needed\n\n Directions\n\nStep 1\n    Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.\n\nStep 2\n    Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\n\nStep 3\n    To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.\n\nStep 4\n    Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nStep 5\n    Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. ",

In 1900, agricultural water use was around 500 km\u00b3, which rose to approximately 2,500 km\u00b3 by 2000. Industrial water use also saw a substantial increase, starting at around 100 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching about 1,000 km\u00b3 in 2000. Domestic water use, while the smallest sector, also showed a steady increase from around 50 km\u00b3 in 1900 to about 500 km\u00b3 in 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 8 m\u00b3. This indicates that Brazil consumes significantly more water per person compared to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIn summary, agriculture is the dominant sector in global water use, followed by industrial and domestic use. Brazil consumes much more water per person than the Democratic Republic of Congo, reflecting differences in population size, irrigated land, and possibly economic activities.",
      "expectedOutput": "The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m\u00b3, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m\u00b3, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.",

It is caused by the fungus Monilinia fructicola and is characterized by brown, rotting spots on the fruit, which can eventually lead to the fruit falling off the tree.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Rot:\nBrown Rot is a serious disease that can significantly reduce fruit yields and quality. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through the tree, affecting both the fruit and the branches.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Brown, rotting spots on the fruit.\n- Fruit may fall prematurely.\n- Affected branches may show signs of canker.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy all infected fruit and branches to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - Prune affected branches back to healthy wood.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply fungicides specifically labeled for Brown Rot control. Commonly used fungicides include captan, chlorothalonil, and copper-based fungicides.\n   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the tree by pruning to maintain an open canopy.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the tree.\n   - Maintain a clean orchard by removing fallen fruit and debris.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant disease-resistant varieties of fruit trees when possible.\n\n### Prevention:\n- Regular monitoring and early detection are key to effective control.\n- Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially after rainy periods or during high humidity.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage Brown Rot and protect your fruit trees from this damaging disease.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is Brown rot (Monilinia fructicola), the most common fungal disease affecting the blossoms and fruit of almonds, apricots, cherries, peaches and plums. It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.",

      "actualOutput": "The painting you provided is \"The Birth of Venus\" by Sandro Botticelli. It is a Renaissance painting created around 1484-1485. The artwork depicts the goddess Venus emerging from the sea, standing on a giant scallop shell. The scene is set against a backdrop of a calm sea and a lush forest. The painting is known for its use of vibrant colors, detailed figures, and the graceful, flowing lines of the figures, which are characteristic of Botticelli's style. It is one of the most famous works of the Italian Renaissance and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.",
      "expectedOutput": "The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.",

It can be shared among colleagues or classmates to lighten the mood and create a shared understanding of the challenges of staying awake and alert.\n\n    Procrastination humor: The meme can also be used to depict the internal struggle between wanting to sleep or rest instead of engaging in productive activities. It can be shared when discussing procrastination or humorous self-reflections on the constant desire to avoid responsibilities and indulge in relaxation.\n\n    Comedic irony: The meme's contradiction between sleep time and wanting to sleep at other times can be used as a form of comedic irony in various contexts. It can be shared when discussing situations where our desires or behaviors contradict what is expected or appropriate, adding a humorous twist to the conversation.\n\nUltimately, the meme can be employed in different situations where its theme of sleepiness, conflicting desires, or ironic situations aligns with the topic or sentiment being discussed, adding a touch of humor and relatability to the conversation or online interaction.",

Blossom End Rot is characterized by the appearance of a dark, sunken, and often leathery area on the bottom of the fruit, opposite the stem end. This condition is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant, which can occur due to irregular water supply, high temperatures, or other environmental factors.\n\n### How to Treat Blossom End Rot:\n\n1. **Improve Watering Practices:**\n   - Ensure consistent and adequate watering to maintain soil moisture. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - Use a mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture.\n\n2. **Apply Calcium Fertilizer:**\n   - Apply a calcium-rich fertilizer to the soil. Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) can also be used, as it contains magnesium, which helps in calcium uptake.\n\n3. **Adjust Soil pH:**\n   - Maintain a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8, as this range is optimal for calcium absorption.\n\n4. **Monitor Soil Moisture:**\n   - Use a soil moisture meter to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering accordingly.\n\n5. **Avoid Over-Fertilizing:**\n   - Excessive nitrogen can interfere with calcium uptake. Use balanced fertilizers and avoid over-fertilizing.\n\n6. **Prune Lower Leaves:**\n   - Prune the lower leaves to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can help in calcium distribution.\n\n7. **Use Organic Matter:**\n   - Incorporate organic matter like compost into the soil to improve its structure and water-holding capacity.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can help prevent and manage Blossom End Rot in your tomato plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

Satellite images provide a broad view of weather patterns, while radar screens offer more detailed information about precipitation and wind. Digital buoys, deployed in the ocean, collect data on sea conditions, and synoptic charts provide a comprehensive overview of atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nIn the second stage, Analysis & Forecasting, the collected data is analyzed to create satellite photos, radar screens, and synoptic charts. These visual representations help meteorologists understand current weather conditions and predict future trends.\n\nIn the final stage, Preparing the Broadcast, the analyzed data is used to prepare weather forecasts for dissemination. These forecasts are then broadcast through various media, including television, radio, and recorded announcements, ensuring that the public receives up-to-date and reliable weather information.\n\nOverall, the diagram demonstrates a systematic and comprehensive approach to weather forecasting, utilizing advanced technology and data analysis to provide accurate and timely information to the public.",

Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.",

This recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.\n\n\nPrep Time:\n1 hr\nCook Time:\n30 mins\nAdditional Time:\n1 hr\nTotal Time:\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServings:\n20\nYield:\n20 egg rolls\n\n\n Ingredients\n\n    4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided\n\n    3 large eggs, beaten\n\n    1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded\n\n    \u00bd carrot, julienned\n\n    1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks\n\n    1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots\n\n    1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated\n\n    2 green onions, thinly sliced\n\n    2 \u00bd teaspoons soy sauce\n\n    1 teaspoon salt\n\n    1 teaspoon sugar\n\n    \u00bd teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)\n\n    1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers\n\n    1 egg white, beaten\n\n    4 cups oil for frying, or as needed\n\n Directions\n\nStep 1\n    Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.\n\nStep 2\n    Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\n\nStep 3\n    To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.\n\nStep 4\n    Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nStep 5\n    Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

Place the bowl in the microwave and heat in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is smooth and completely melted.\n\n3. **Dip the Cookies:**\n   - Using a fork or a dipping tool, dip each Oreo cookie into the melted chocolate, covering it completely.\n   - Gently tap the cookie to remove any excess chocolate.\n\n4. **Decorate with Sprinkles:**\n   - While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle the cookies with the colorful sprinkles. You can use a variety of sprinkles or stick to a specific color scheme.\n\n5. **Cool and Set:**\n   - Place the decorated cookies back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.\n   - Allow the chocolate to set and harden at room temperature, or you can place the cookies in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes to speed up the process.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Once the chocolate is set, the cookies are ready to be served. Enjoy!\n\nThese chocolate-dipped Oreo cookies are perfect for holiday parties or as a festive treat. You can customize the sprinkles to match any occasion or theme.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the picture is **corn smut**. Corn smut is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen *Ustilago maydis*. It affects corn plants by forming galls on various parts of the plant, including the ears, leaves, and stalks. These galls are initially white and soft but turn brown and powdery as they mature, releasing spores that can infect other plants.\n\n### Introduction to Corn Smut\nCorn smut is a significant problem in corn production, as it can reduce yields and affect the quality of the crop. The disease is characterized by the formation of galls, which are abnormal growths on the plant. These galls can be quite large and are filled with a powdery, blackish substance that contains the fungal spores.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Remove and Destroy Infected Plants:** Remove and destroy infected plants to reduce the number of spores in the field.\n   - **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting corn in the same field for several years in a row.\n   - **Clean Seed:** Use certified, disease-free seed to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially in areas with a history of corn smut. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Genetic Resistance:**\n   - **Plant Resistant Varieties:** Use corn varieties that are resistant to corn smut. Consult with local agricultural extension services for recommendations on resistant varieties.\n\n4. **Sanitation:**\n   - **Clean Farm Equipment:** Clean farm equipment thoroughly after use to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n### Conclusion\nCorn smut is a serious disease that can significantly impact corn production. Implementing a combination of cultural practices, chemical control, and using resistant varieties can help manage and prevent the disease. Regular monitoring of the crop and early intervention are key to effective control.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

      "actualOutput": "The graph illustrates the global water usage by sector from 1900 to 2000, while the table provides data on water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the year 2000.\n\nFrom the graph, it is evident that agriculture is the largest consumer of water, with its usage increasing significantly over the century. In 1900, agricultural water use was around 500 km\u00b3, which rose to approximately 2,500 km\u00b3 by 2000. Industrial water use also saw a substantial increase, starting at around 100 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching about 1,000 km\u00b3 in 2000. Domestic water use, while the smallest sector, also showed a steady increase from around 50 km\u00b3 in 1900 to about 500 km\u00b3 in 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 8 m\u00b3. This indicates that Brazil consumes significantly more water per person compared to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIn summary, agriculture is the largest water-consuming sector globally, followed by industry and domestic use. Brazil consumes much more water per person than the Democratic Republic of Congo, which may be attributed to its larger population and more extensive irrigated land.",
      "expectedOutput": "The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m\u00b3, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m\u00b3, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.",

Apple scab is a common and serious disease that affects apple trees, causing brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. It can significantly reduce the yield and quality of apples.\n\n### Introduction to Apple Scab:\n- **Symptoms**: Brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit.\n- **Impact**: Reduces yield and quality of apples.\n- **Cause**: Fungus Venturia inaequalis.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention:\n1. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Pruning**: Remove infected branches and leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n   - **Sanitation**: Clean up fallen leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus.\n   - **Planting Distance**: Ensure proper spacing between trees to improve air circulation.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Fungicides**: Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or copper-based products. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n   - **Timing**: Apply fungicides before and after bloom, and continue at regular intervals throughout the growing season.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties**:\n   - Plant apple varieties that are resistant to apple scab.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Monitor the orchard regularly for signs of infection.\n   - Use weather-based models to predict the risk of infection and time fungicide applications accordingly.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage apple scab and protect your apple trees.",
      "expectedOutput": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.",

      "expectedOutput": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to cook this dish:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **Tortillas** (flour or corn)\n- **Protein** (chicken, beef, or pork)\n- **Vegetables** (onions, bell peppers, tomatoes)\n- **Cheese** (shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack)\n- **Coleslaw** (cabbage, carrots, mayonnaise, vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper)\n- **Lime wedges**\n- **Salsa** (optional)\n- **Sour cream** (optional)\n- **Guacamole** (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Protein:\n1. **Marinate the Protein**: If using chicken or pork, marinate it with your favorite spices (e.g., chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper) for at least 30 minutes.\n2. **Cook the Protein**: Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated protein and cook until it\u2019s browned and cooked through. For beef, you can grill or pan-fry it.\n\n#### 2. Prepare the Vegetables:\n1. **Chop the Vegetables**: Finely chop onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes.\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables**: In the same skillet, add the chopped vegetables and cook until they are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n#### 3. Assemble the Tacos:\n1. **Warm the Tortillas**: Heat the tortillas in a dry skillet or wrap them in foil and heat them in the oven for a few minutes.\n2. **Fill the Tortillas**: Place the cooked protein and vegetables in the center of the tortilla. Add shredded cheese on top.\n\n#### 4. Prepare the Coleslaw:\n1. **Mix the Cabbage and Carrots**: In a large bowl, combine shredded cabbage and grated carrots.\n2. **Make the Dressing**: In a separate bowl, mix mayonnaise, white vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper until well combined.\n3. **Combine the Coleslaw**: Pour the dressing over the cabbage and carrots and mix well.\n\n#### 5. Serve:\n1. **Plate the Tacos**: Place the filled tortillas on a plate.\n2. **Add the Coleslaw**: Serve the coleslaw on the side or mix it with the tacos.\n3. **Garnish**: Add lime wedges, salsa, sour cream, or guacamole as desired.\n\n### Tips:\n- **Tortilla Type**: Use flour tortillas for a softer texture or corn tortillas for a more authentic Mexican flavor.\n- **Protein Variations**: You can use any protein of your choice, such as shrimp, fish, or even a vegetarian option like beans or tofu.\n- **Coleslaw Variations**: You can add other vegetables like radishes or jalape\u00f1os to the coleslaw for extra flavor.\n\nEnjoy your homemade tacos and coleslaw!",

This site is situated in a countryside area, away from the town center, and is accessible via main roads. It is relatively isolated from the town's housing and industrial zones.\n\nSite S2, on the other hand, is located within the town center, which is a no-traffic zone. This site is surrounded by housing and is in close proximity to the industrial area. It is approximately 25 km from Cransdon (population 29,000) and is accessible via main roads and a railway line.\n\nComparing the two sites, S1 offers a more secluded location, away from the town's hustle and bustle, and is closer to the countryside. It is also more accessible to residents of Hindon and Bransdon. In contrast, S2 is centrally located within Garlsdon, providing easy access to the town's residents and being closer to the industrial area. However, it is situated in a no-traffic zone, which may pose challenges for transportation and logistics.\n\nIn summary, Site S1 is a more rural option, while Site S2 is a more urban choice, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific needs and preferences of the supermarket and the local community.",

S2 is also close to the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.\n\nThere are main roads from Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon to Garlsdon town centre, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon.

Satellite images provide a broad view of weather patterns, while radar screens offer more detailed information about precipitation and wind. Digital buoys, deployed in the ocean, measure temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric conditions. Synoptic charts, which are maps showing pressure systems and fronts, are also used to understand the overall weather situation.\n\nIn the second stage, analysis and forecasting, the collected data is analyzed to create satellite photos and radar screens. These visual representations help meteorologists understand the current weather conditions and predict future weather patterns.\n\nIn the final stage, preparing the broadcast, the analyzed data is used to create weather forecasts. These forecasts are then disseminated through various channels, including TV newsreaders, radio broadcasts, and recorded announcements.\n\nOverall, the diagram shows a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to weather forecasting, utilizing a range of technologies and data sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information.",

This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.\n\nLooking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.",

      "input": "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?",
      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is known as \"Brown Spot,\" which is a common fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including many types of trees, shrubs, and vegetables. Brown Spot is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and shape. These spots often have a darker border and can cause the leaves to become discolored, wilted, or even fall off.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot\nBrown Spot is caused by various fungal pathogens, including Alternaria, Cercospora, and Septoria species. These fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions and can spread quickly through water droplets, wind, or contact with infected plants. The disease can weaken plants, reduce their growth, and affect their overall health.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Spot\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Do not compost infected plant material, as it can harbor the fungus.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity levels. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Watering Practices**: Water plants at the base rather than overhead to minimize the spread of fungal spores. Avoid watering late in the day to prevent prolonged leaf wetness.\n\n4. **Fungicides**: Apply a fungicide labeled for Brown Spot control. Copper-based fungicides, sulfur, and neem oil are effective against many fungal diseases. Follow the instructions on the label for proper application and safety.\n\n5. **Resistant Varieties**: If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot. Many plant breeders have developed varieties with improved resistance to common fungal diseases.\n\n6. **Clean Tools and Equipment**: Sanitize pruning tools and other gardening equipment to prevent the spread of fungal spores from one plant to another.\n\n7. **Crop Rotation**: For vegetable gardens, practice crop rotation to avoid planting the same or related crops in the same location year after year, as this can help reduce the buildup of fungal pathogens in the soil.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Brown Spot, helping to keep your plants healthy and thriving.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is early blight. Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",

      "expectedOutput": "The Arnolfini Portrait (or The Arnolfini Wedding, The Arnolfini Marriage, the Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife, or other titles) is a 1434 oil painting on oak panel by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

Gray mold typically appears as a gray, fuzzy growth on the fruit, often accompanied by a musty smell. It can spread quickly, especially in damp and humid conditions.\n\n### How to Treat Gray Mold:\n\n1. **Remove Infected Fruit:**\n   - Carefully remove and dispose of any infected strawberries to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n2. **Prune Affected Areas:**\n   - Prune any infected leaves or stems to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n\n3. **Improve Air Circulation:**\n   - Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity levels.\n\n4. **Avoid Overwatering:**\n   - Water plants in the morning to allow them to dry out before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can increase humidity around the plants.\n\n5. **Apply Fungicides:**\n   - Use a fungicide labeled for use on strawberries. Follow the instructions carefully, and apply it as directed.\n\n6. **Use Organic Controls:**\n   - Consider using organic fungicides such as copper or sulfur-based products.\n\n7. **Plant Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Choose strawberry varieties that are resistant to gray mold.\n\n8. **Sanitize Tools and Equipment:**\n   - Clean and sanitize all gardening tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help control and prevent the spread of gray mold in your strawberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

      "actualOutput": "The image shows a tree with resin or sap oozing out, which is a common symptom of a condition known as \"canker.\" Canker is a disease that affects trees and woody plants, causing lesions or wounds on the bark. These lesions can lead to the death of branches or even the entire tree if left untreated.\n\n### Introduction to Canker Disease:\nCanker disease is caused by various fungi and bacteria that infect the bark and cambium layer of trees. It can be spread through wounds, insect damage, or poor pruning practices. The disease weakens the tree, making it susceptible to further infections and environmental stresses.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Resin or sap oozing from the bark\n- Sunken or raised lesions on the bark\n- Cracks or splits in the bark\n- Dieback of branches\n- Discoloration of leaves\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Prune Affected Branches:**\n   - Remove and dispose of infected branches to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Use clean, sharp pruning tools and disinfect them between cuts.\n\n2. **Apply Fungicide:**\n   - Use a registered fungicide to treat the affected areas. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.\n\n3. **Improve Tree Health:**\n   - Ensure the tree is well-watered and fertilized to boost its immune system.\n   - Avoid overwatering, as excess moisture can promote fungal growth.\n\n4. **Preventative Measures:**\n   - Practice good pruning techniques to avoid creating wounds that can be infected.\n   - Keep the area around the tree clean and free of debris.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional:**\n   - If the disease is severe or widespread, consult an arborist or a plant pathologist for specialized treatment.\n\nBy addressing the symptoms and taking preventative measures, you can help manage and control canker disease in trees.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.",

His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine. Pasteur's works are credited with saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

It is caused by the fungus Monilinia fructicola and is characterized by brown, rotting spots on the fruit, which can spread rapidly under favorable conditions.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Rot:\nBrown Rot is a serious disease that can cause significant damage to fruit crops. It typically starts as small, brown spots on the fruit, which can enlarge and turn into large, sunken, and often cracked areas. The fungus can also infect flowers, leaves, and twigs, leading to blossom blight and twig cankers.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention:\n1. **Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy all infected fruit and plant debris from the orchard to reduce the number of fungal spores.\n   - Prune and dispose of infected twigs and branches.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation in the orchard by spacing trees appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead irrigation to prevent wetting of the fruit.\n\n3. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply fungicides during the growing season, especially after rain or irrigation events.\n   - Commonly used fungicides include captan, chlorothalonil, and copper-based products.\n\n4. **Biological Control:**\n   - Use biocontrol agents such as Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma spp. to suppress the fungus.\n\n5. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant disease-resistant varieties when available.\n\n### Integrated Pest Management (IPM):\n- Implement an IPM strategy that combines multiple control methods to manage the disease effectively and reduce the reliance on chemical treatments.\n\nBy following these practices, you can effectively manage Brown Rot and protect your fruit trees from this damaging disease.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is Brown rot (Monilinia fructicola), the most common fungal disease affecting the blossoms and fruit of almonds, apricots, cherries, peaches and plums. It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.",

      "actualOutput": "The graph illustrates the global water usage by sector from 1900 to 2000, while the table provides data on water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the year 2000.\n\nFrom the graph, it is evident that agriculture is the largest consumer of water, with usage increasing significantly over the century. In 1900, agricultural water use was around 500 km\u00b3, and by 2000, it had risen to approximately 2,500 km\u00b3. Industrial water use also saw a substantial increase, starting at around 100 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching about 1,000 km\u00b3 in 2000. Domestic water use, while the smallest sector, also showed growth, starting at 50 km\u00b3 in 1900 and increasing to around 500 km\u00b3 in 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 8 m\u00b3. This indicates that Brazil consumes significantly more water per person compared to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows a clear trend of increasing water usage across all sectors, with agriculture being the most significant consumer. The table highlights the stark difference in water consumption between Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with Brazil using much more water per person.",
      "expectedOutput": "The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m\u00b3, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m\u00b3, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is known as \"Brown Spot,\" which is a common fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including many types of trees, shrubs, and vegetables. Brown Spot is caused by various fungi, including Alternaria and Septoria species, and is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot:\nBrown Spot typically starts as small, circular spots on the leaves, which can enlarge and merge over time. The spots may have a darker margin and a lighter center, and they can cause the leaves to yellow and eventually fall off. This disease can weaken the plant and reduce its overall health and productivity.\n\n### Treatment for Brown Spot:\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves:**\n   - Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation:**\n   - Ensure that the plant has good air circulation around it. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Avoid Overwatering:**\n   - Water plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can spread the fungus.\n\n4. **Use Fungicides:**\n   - Apply a fungicide labeled for use on Brown Spot. Copper-based fungicides or products containing mancozeb or chlorothalonil can be effective. Follow the instructions on the label for proper application.\n\n5. **Plant Resistant Varieties:**\n   - If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot.\n\n6. **Clean Tools:**\n   - Sanitize pruning tools and gardening equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n7. **Mulch:**\n   - Use a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to keep the soil cool and moist, which can help reduce the spread of the fungus.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help manage and control Brown Spot, ensuring the health and vitality of your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is early blight. Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",

Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad or neem oil, which are effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.\n   - Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of leaf miner populations in the soil.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to physically prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control leaf miner damage in your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.",

Gray mold typically appears as a gray, fuzzy growth on the fruit, often accompanied by a musty smell. It can spread quickly, especially in damp and humid conditions.\n\n### How to Treat Gray Mold:\n\n1. **Remove Infected Fruits:**\n   - Carefully remove and dispose of any infected strawberries to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n2. **Prune Affected Areas:**\n   - Prune any infected leaves or stems to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n\n3. **Improve Air Circulation:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants to reduce humidity levels.\n\n4. **Avoid Overwatering:**\n   - Water plants in the morning to allow them to dry out before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can increase humidity around the plants.\n\n5. **Apply Fungicides:**\n   - Use a fungicide labeled for use on strawberries. Follow the instructions carefully, and apply it as directed.\n\n6. **Maintain Cleanliness:**\n   - Keep the area around the plants clean and free of debris, which can harbor the fungus.\n\n7. **Use Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Consider planting strawberry varieties that are resistant to gray mold.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help control and prevent the spread of gray mold in your strawberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

This artwork is a pioneering example of Northern Renaissance art, known for its meticulous detail and use of oil paint to achieve a lifelike quality. The painting depicts a couple, believed to be Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife, in a domestic setting, with various symbolic elements that suggest themes of marriage, fertility, and domestic life. The reflection in the mirror in the background is particularly notable, as it shows the artist and a second observer, adding a layer of complexity to the scene. The painting is celebrated for its rich symbolism, detailed realism, and innovative use of perspective and light.",

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is known as \"Brown Spot,\" which is a common fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including many types of trees, shrubs, and vegetables. Brown Spot is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and shape. These spots often have a darker border and can cause the leaves to become discolored, wilted, or even fall off.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot\nBrown Spot is caused by various fungi, including Alternaria, Cercospora, and Septoria species. These fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions and can spread quickly through water droplets, wind, or contact with infected plants. The disease can weaken plants, reduce their growth, and affect their overall health.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Spot\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Do not compost infected plant material, as the fungus can survive in the compost.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Avoid Overwatering**: Water plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can spread the fungus.\n\n4. **Use Fungicides**: Apply a fungicide labeled for Brown Spot control. Copper-based fungicides, mancozeb, and chlorothalonil are commonly used. Follow the instructions on the label carefully.\n\n5. **Plant Resistant Varieties**: If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot.\n\n6. **Clean Tools and Equipment**: Sanitize pruning tools and other gardening equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n7. **Practice Crop Rotation**: If the disease affects vegetables, practice crop rotation to avoid planting susceptible crops in the same location for several years.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Brown Spot, helping to keep your plants healthy and thriving.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is early blight. Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",

Here is a general recipe to make fried spring rolls:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 10-12 spring roll wrappers\n- 2 cups of mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, cabbage, bell peppers, beansprouts, etc.), finely chopped\n- 1 cup of cooked meat (e.g., chicken, pork, shrimp, etc.), finely chopped (optional)\n- 1/2 cup of cooked rice or noodles (optional)\n- 1/4 cup of soy sauce\n- 1/4 cup of oyster sauce\n- 1/4 cup of fish sauce\n- 1/4 cup of sugar\n- 1/4 cup of water\n- 1/4 cup of cornstarch\n- Vegetable oil for frying\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a bowl, mix the chopped vegetables, meat (if using), and rice or noodles (if using).\n   - In another bowl, mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, sugar, water, and cornstarch. Stir well to combine.\n   - Add the sauce mixture to the vegetable and meat mixture. Mix well to coat the ingredients.\n\n2. **Assemble the Spring Rolls:**\n   - Place a spring roll wrapper on a flat surface with the shorter end facing you.\n   - Spoon about 1/4 cup of the filling mixture onto the center of the wrapper.\n   - Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the filling.\n   - Fold in the sides of the wrapper.\n   - Roll the spring roll up tightly, sealing the edges with a little bit of water.\n\n3. **Fry the Spring Rolls:**\n   - Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok over medium-high heat.\n   - Once the oil is hot (test by dropping a small piece of bread into the oil; it should sizzle immediately), carefully place the spring rolls into the oil.\n   - Fry the spring rolls until they are golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes.\n   - Use a slotted spoon to remove the spring rolls from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the fried spring rolls hot with your favorite dipping sauce, such as sweet chili sauce or hoisin sauce.\n\nEnjoy your homemade fried spring rolls!",

If I like this, then you will. This is very authentic because my family is Chinese and I am too. This recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.\n\n\nPrep Time:\n1 hr\nCook Time:\n30 mins\nAdditional Time:\n1 hr\nTotal Time:\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServings:\n20\nYield:\n20 egg rolls\n\n\n Ingredients\n\n    4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided\n\n    3 large eggs, beaten\n\n    1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded\n\n    \u00bd carrot, julienned\n\n    1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks\n\n    1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots\n\n    1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated\n\n    2 green onions, thinly sliced\n\n    2 \u00bd teaspoons soy sauce\n\n    1 teaspoon salt\n\n    1 teaspoon sugar\n\n    \u00bd teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)\n\n    1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers\n\n    1 egg white, beaten\n\n    4 cups oil for frying, or as needed\n\n Directions\n\nStep 1\n    Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.\n\nStep 2\n    Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\n\nStep 3\n    To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.\n\nStep 4\n    Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nStep 5\n    Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels. ",

The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",

Blossom End Rot is characterized by the appearance of a dark, sunken, and often leathery area on the bottom of the fruit, opposite the stem end. This condition is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant, which can occur due to irregular water supply, high temperatures, or other environmental factors.\n\n### How to Treat Blossom End Rot:\n\n1. **Improve Watering Practices:**\n   - Ensure consistent and adequate watering to maintain soil moisture. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - Use a mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Apply Calcium Fertilizer:**\n   - Apply a calcium-rich fertilizer to the soil. Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) can also be used, as it contains magnesium, which helps in the absorption of calcium.\n   - Foliar sprays of calcium chloride can be applied directly to the leaves to help the plant absorb calcium more efficiently.\n\n3. **Adjust Soil pH:**\n   - Maintain a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8, as this range is optimal for calcium absorption.\n   - Test the soil pH and adjust it if necessary using lime or sulfur.\n\n4. **Improve Soil Structure:**\n   - Add organic matter such as compost to the soil to improve its structure and water-holding capacity.\n   - Ensure good soil aeration to promote root growth and nutrient uptake.\n\n5. **Monitor and Adjust Fertilization:**\n   - Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, as high nitrogen levels can interfere with calcium uptake.\n   - Use a balanced fertilizer that is low in nitrogen and high in potassium and phosphorus.\n\n6. **Prune Excess Foliage:**\n   - Remove excess leaves to improve air circulation and reduce the risk of fungal diseases, which can exacerbate Blossom End Rot.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can help prevent and manage Blossom End Rot in your tomato plants, ensuring healthier and more productive crops.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

The number of emigrants also increased during this period, but at a slower rate, reaching a peak of around 420,000 in 2007. The net migration, which is the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, fluctuated during this period, with a peak of around 220,000 in 2004 and a low of around 140,000 in 2001.\n\nOverall, the number of immigrants in the UK was consistently higher than the number of emigrants during this period, resulting in a positive net migration. The net migration was highest in 2004, when the number of immigrants was significantly higher than the number of emigrants. In contrast, the net migration was lowest in 2001, when the number of immigrants and emigrants was more balanced.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows that the UK experienced a steady increase in the number of immigrants and emigrants from 1999 to 2008, with a positive net migration throughout this period. The net migration was highest in 2004 and lowest in 2001.",

Net migration peaked in 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn 1999, over 450,000 people came to live in the UK, while the number of people who emigrated stood at just under 300,000. The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nAfter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.",

This recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.\n\n\nPrep Time:\n1 hr\nCook Time:\n30 mins\nAdditional Time:\n1 hr\nTotal Time:\n2 hrs 30 mins\nServings:\n20\nYield:\n20 egg rolls\n\n\n Ingredients\n\n    4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided\n\n    3 large eggs, beaten\n\n    1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded\n\n    \u00bd carrot, julienned\n\n    1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks\n\n    1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots\n\n    1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated\n\n    2 green onions, thinly sliced\n\n    2 \u00bd teaspoons soy sauce\n\n    1 teaspoon salt\n\n    1 teaspoon sugar\n\n    \u00bd teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)\n\n    1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers\n\n    1 egg white, beaten\n\n    4 cups oil for frying, or as needed\n\n Directions\n\nStep 1\n    Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.\n\nStep 2\n    Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.\n\nStep 3\n    To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.\n\nStep 4\n    Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).\n\nStep 5\n    Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

Place the bowl in the microwave and heat in 30-second intervals, stirring after each interval, until the chocolate is smooth and completely melted.\n\n3. **Dip the Cookies:**\n   - Using a fork or a dipping tool, dip each Oreo cookie into the melted chocolate, covering it completely.\n   - Gently tap the cookie to remove any excess chocolate.\n\n4. **Decorate with Sprinkles:**\n   - While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle the cookies with the colorful sprinkles. You can use a variety of sprinkles or stick to a specific color scheme.\n\n5. **Cool and Set:**\n   - Place the decorated cookies back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.\n   - Allow the chocolate to set and harden at room temperature, or you can place the cookies in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes to speed up the process.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Once the chocolate is set, the cookies are ready to be served. Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator.\n\nThese chocolate-dipped Oreo cookies are perfect for holiday parties, as gifts, or simply as a sweet treat.

The village has experienced steady population growth since the mid-nineteenth century, and the map shows how the village has expanded and changed over time.\n\nIn 1868, Chorleywood was a small village with a few scattered buildings. The main roads were already in place, and the railway line, which was built in 1909, was not yet present. By 1883, the village had started to grow, with new buildings appearing along the main roads. The railway station, which was built in 1909, became a significant hub for the village, connecting it to other parts of London.\n\nBetween 1883 and 1922, the village continued to expand, with new buildings appearing in various parts of the village. The motorway, which was built in 1970, became a major thoroughfare, connecting Chorleywood to other parts of the country. The village also saw the development of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which became a popular recreational area for the residents.\n\nFrom 1922 to 1970, the village continued to grow, with new buildings appearing in various parts of the village. The railway station remained a significant hub, and the motorway became a major thoroughfare, connecting Chorleywood to other parts of the country. The village also saw the development of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which became a popular recreational area for the residents.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1994, the village continued to grow, with new buildings appearing in various parts of the village. The railway station remained a significant hub, and the motorway became a major thoroughfare, connecting Chorleywood to other parts of the country. The village also saw the development of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which became a popular recreational area for the residents.\n\nIn summary, the map shows how Chorleywood has developed from a small village in 1868 to a thriving community in 1994. The village has seen significant growth and development, with new buildings appearing in various parts of the village, and the development of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.

Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",

The proportion of spending on leisure and education was also highest in Turkey, at 4.35%, while expenditure on clothing and footwear was significantly higher in Italy, at 9%, than in any of the other countries.\n\nIt can be seen that Sweden had the lowest percentages of national consumer expenditure for food/drinks/tobacco and for clothing/footwear, at nearly 16% and just over 5% respectively.

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the picture is **corn smut**. Corn smut is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen *Ustilago maydis*. It affects corn plants by forming galls on various parts of the plant, including the ears, leaves, and stalks. These galls are initially white and soft but turn brown and powdery as they mature, releasing spores that can infect other plants.\n\n### Introduction to Corn Smut\nCorn smut is a significant problem in corn production, as it can reduce yields and affect the quality of the crop. The disease is characterized by the formation of galls, which are abnormal growths on the plant. These galls can be quite large and are filled with a powdery, blackish substance that contains the fungal spores.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Remove and Destroy Infected Plants:** Remove and destroy infected plants to reduce the number of spores in the field.\n   - **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting corn in the same field for several years in a row.\n   - **Clean Seed:** Use certified, disease-free seed to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially in areas with a history of corn smut. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Genetic Resistance:**\n   - **Plant Resistant Varieties:** Use corn varieties that are resistant to corn smut. Consult with local agricultural extension services for recommendations on resistant varieties.\n\n4. **Sanitation:**\n   - **Clean Farm Equipment:** Clean farm equipment thoroughly after use to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n### Conclusion\nCorn smut is a serious disease that can significantly impact corn production. Implementing a combination of cultural practices, chemical control, and using resistant varieties can help manage and prevent the disease. Regular monitoring of the crop and early intervention are key to effective control.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the picture is **corn smut**. Corn smut is a fungal disease caused by the pathogen *Ustilago maydis*. It affects corn plants by forming galls on various parts of the plant, including the ears, leaves, and stalks. These galls are initially white and soft but turn brown and powdery as they mature, releasing spores that can infect other plants.\n\n### Introduction to Corn Smut\nCorn smut is a significant problem in corn production, as it can reduce yields and affect the quality of the crop. The disease is characterized by the formation of galls, which are abnormal growths on the plant. These galls can be quite large and are filled with a powdery, blackish substance that contains the fungal spores.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Remove and Destroy Infected Plants:** Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting corn in the same field for several years in a row.\n   - **Clean Seed:** Use certified, disease-free seed to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides as a preventive measure, especially in areas with a history of corn smut. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n3. **Genetic Resistance:**\n   - **Plant Resistant Varieties:** Use corn varieties that are resistant to corn smut. Consult with local agricultural extension services for recommendations on resistant varieties.\n\n4. **Sanitation:**\n   - **Clean Farm Equipment:** Clean farm equipment thoroughly after use to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n### Conclusion\nCorn smut is a serious disease that can significantly impact corn production. Implementing a combination of cultural practices, chemical control, and using resistant varieties can help manage and prevent the disease. Regular monitoring of the crop and early intervention are key to effective control.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is corn smut. Frequently found in backyard gardens and small farms, corn smut is caused by the fungus Ustilago zeae and can appear in the stalks, leaves, tassels or ears. Symptoms are most commonly noticed when the ears produce mushroom-like tumors or galls. These \u201cswellings\u201d begin as small, whitish-gray irregularities which expand and turn black as they fill with spores. Ear galls can grow to 4- to 5-inches in diameter and release thousands of spores as they rupture. These fungal spores are blown by the wind for considerable distances to infect new plants. Galls on leaves remain small and eventually become hard and dry.\n\nCorn smut overwinters on garden debris and in the soil. It is carried by wind, rain and irrigation and does best in hot, dry weather. Spores may remain viable for 5- to 7-years. Wounds from various injuries, including cultivation and abrasion from blowing soil, provide points for the fungus to enter the plant.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose the best resistant varieties, such as silver king, fantasia, brilliant and seneca sensation, when available.\n2. In backyard gardens, collecting and destroying galls before the dark fungal spores are released is suggested. This will limit the number of available fungal spores and help break the disease-cycle.\n3. Reduce infection points by avoiding injury of roots, stalks and leaves during cultivation.\n4. Prevent damage from insects, such as corn borers, with Monterey\u00ae Garden Insect Spray or other organic insecticide.\n5. Fungicides are NOT an effective control option since the disease is so widespread and can persist in the soil for years.\n6. High nitrogen fertilizers may increase the severity of the disease \u2014 use a balanced organic fertilizer in the vegetable garden.\n7. Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\n8. Bag or burn infected plant parts \u2014 do NOT compost.",

      "actualOutput": "The image shows a tree with resin or sap oozing out, which is a common symptom of a condition known as \"canker\" or \"tree canker.\" Canker is a disease that affects trees and woody plants, causing the bark to die and the tree to weaken. It can be caused by various factors, including fungal infections, bacterial infections, and environmental stress.\n\n### Introduction to Canker\nCanker is a serious disease that can lead to the death of trees if not treated promptly. It typically starts as a small lesion on the bark, which then spreads and causes the bark to die and fall off. The affected area often oozes sap or resin, as seen in the image.\n\n### Treatment of Canker\nTreating canker involves several steps:\n\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation**:\n   - Remove and dispose of any dead or diseased branches to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Prune back to healthy wood, ensuring that the cuts are made at least 1 inch below the visible signs of disease.\n\n2. **Wound Dressing**:\n   - Apply a wound dressing or tree sealant to the pruning cuts to prevent further infection.\n   - This helps to protect the tree from additional pathogens and promotes healing.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application**:\n   - If the canker is caused by a fungal infection, apply a suitable fungicide to the affected area.\n   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully, as some fungicides may be harmful to the tree if used incorrectly.\n\n4. **Preventive Measures**:\n   - Ensure the tree is well-watered and fertilized to promote overall health.\n   - Avoid wounding the tree, as wounds can provide entry points for pathogens.\n\n5. **Professional Help**:\n   - Consult with a certified arborist or a plant pathologist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n   - They can provide specific advice based on the type of tree and the severity of the canker.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage and potentially control the spread of canker, thereby preserving the health of the tree.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.",

Follow the instructions carefully, and apply it as directed.\n\n6. **Use Organic Controls:**\n   - Consider using organic fungicides such as copper or sulfur-based products.\n\n7. **Plant Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Choose strawberry varieties that are resistant to gray mold.\n\n8. **Sanitize Tools and Equipment:**\n   - Clean and sanitize all gardening tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help control and prevent the spread of gray mold in your strawberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is gray mold (Botrytis cinerea). Found on a wide range of plants (too many to mention), gray mold is a fungal disease that travels quickly through gardens, especially during damp, cool to mild weather. Disease symptoms appear as grayish colored soft, mushy spots on leaves, stems, flowers and on produce. Spots may become covered with a coating of gray fungus spores, especially if humidity is high. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop black, stone-like sclerotia \u2014 a compact mass of hardened fungal filaments \u2014 under rotted parts.\n\nGray mold is often found near the soil surface or in the densest areas of the plant canopy. It develops on wilted flowers first, then spreads quickly to other parts of the plant. The disease may also occur in storage areas causing rotting of harvested fruits and vegetables.\n\nBotrytis blight overwinters on plants, in or on the soil, and as sclerotia. Spores develop when conditions are optimal, and are moved by wind or splashing water onto blossoms or young leaves, where they germinate and enter the plant. Spores require cool temperatures (45-60 F.) and high humidity (93% and above) to germinate. Germinating spores rarely penetrate green, healthy tissue directly, but can enter through wounds on growing plants. Cuttings are particularly susceptible to infection.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation between plants. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n2. If growing indoors use a small clip-on fan to improve air flow.\n3. Keep the soil under plants clean and rake up any fallen debris.\n4. Add a good amount of organic compost or mulch under plants. Mulches will prevent the fungal spores from splashing back up onto flowers and leaves.\n5. Water in the early morning hours, or use a soaker hose, to give plants time to dry out during the day.\n6. Do not compost infected plant leaves or stems, and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n7. Copper-Soap fungicides will help by protecting plants from disease spores. Apply at the start of flowering and continue every 7-10 days until harvest. Fungicidal sprays are especially warranted when weather forecasts predict a long period of cool, wet weather.\n8. Safely treat most fungal diseases, including Botrytis blight, with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n9. Mycostop, a biological fungicide approved for organic use, has shown suppression of the disease. Direct spray (5 gm/ 50 liters of water) to susceptible leaves, flowers and fruits to point of run-off. Apply every 2-3 weeks, or as needed depending on disease pressure.\n10. Green Cure Fungicide contains a patented formula of potassium bicarbonate \u2014 commonly used in food products \u2014 that kills many plant diseases on contact and provides up to 2 weeks of residual protection. At first sign of disease, mix 1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water and apply to all exposed surfaces of the plant. For best protection, repeat at 1-2 week intervals until conditions are no longer favorable for disease development.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is called \"Brown Spot,\" which is a common fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including many types of trees, shrubs, and vegetables. Brown Spot is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and shape. These spots often have a darker border and can cause the leaves to yellow and eventually fall off.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot\nBrown Spot is caused by various fungi, including Alternaria, Cercospora, and Septoria species. The disease thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly, especially in crowded or poorly ventilated areas. It can weaken plants, reduce their growth, and affect their overall health.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Spot\n\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Do not compost infected plant material, as it can harbor the disease.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Avoid Overwatering**: Water plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, which can spread the fungus.\n\n4. **Use Fungicides**: Apply a fungicide labeled for Brown Spot control. Copper-based fungicides and neem oil are effective against many fungal diseases, including Brown Spot.\n\n5. **Plant Resistant Varieties**: If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot.\n\n6. **Clean Tools and Equipment**: Sanitize pruning tools and other gardening equipment to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n7. **Practice Crop Rotation**: If the disease affects vegetables, practice crop rotation to avoid planting susceptible crops in the same location for several years.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Brown Spot, helping to keep your plants healthy and thriving.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is early blight. Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is apple scab, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab is a common and serious disease that affects apple trees, causing brown or orange spots on leaves and fruit, which can lead to leaf drop and poor fruit quality.\n\n### Introduction to Apple Scab:\nApple scab is a fungal disease that primarily affects apple trees. It is characterized by the appearance of brown or orange spots on leaves and fruit. The disease can cause significant damage to apple trees, leading to reduced fruit quality and yield.\n\n### Treatment of Apple Scab:\n1. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infected leaves and twigs to reduce the amount of fungal spores.\n   - **Sanitation:** Clean up the orchard by removing fallen leaves and fruits to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus.\n   - **Planting Resistant Varieties:** Choose apple varieties that are resistant to apple scab.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or copper-based fungicides according to the label instructions. Timing is crucial, and applications should be made before and after bloom.\n   - **Bordeaux Mixture:** A mixture of copper sulfate and lime can be effective in controlling apple scab.\n\n3. **Biological Control:**\n   - **Trichoderma:** Some strains of Trichoderma can be used as a biological control agent to suppress apple scab.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**\n   - **Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the orchard for signs of infection and adjust control measures accordingly.\n   - **Weather-Based Spraying:** Use weather data to predict the risk of infection and time fungicide applications accordingly.\n\n### Prevention:\n- **Proper Planting:** Ensure good air circulation by spacing trees appropriately.\n- **Avoid Overwatering:** Reduce humidity around the trees by avoiding overhead watering.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage and control apple scab, protecting your apple trees and ensuring a healthy yield.",
      "expectedOutput": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.",

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

The disease is prevalent in areas with high humidity and can spread rapidly, especially during wet conditions.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Dark, sunken lesions on canes and fruit.\n- Distorted and bumpy appearance of affected areas.\n- Potential dieback of canes.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy all infected canes and fruit to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Prune back to healthy tissue, ensuring that all affected parts are removed.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the plants.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application:**\n   - Apply a fungicide registered for use on blackberry plants, such as copper-based fungicides or products containing mancozeb.\n   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Consider planting blackberry varieties that are resistant to Blackberry Canker.\n\n### Prevention:\n- Maintain good garden hygiene by cleaning up and disposing of plant debris.\n- Avoid planting blackberry plants in areas with poor air circulation or high humidity.\n- Use certified disease-free planting material.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and control Blackberry Canker, ensuring the health and productivity of your blackberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is crown gall, a common plant disease caused by the soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

By 2000, the total production had increased to 170 units, with coal still being the dominant source, producing 130 units. Natural gas and oil each contributed 2 units, while hydro power remained at 10 units, and nuclear power was introduced, contributing 36 units.\n\nIn France, in 1980, nuclear power was the leading source, producing 25 units out of a total of 90 units. Coal and natural gas each contributed 25 units, while oil and hydro power generated 15 and 5 units, respectively. By 2000, the total production had increased to 180 units, with nuclear power becoming the dominant source, producing 126 units. Coal and natural gas each contributed 25 units, while oil and hydro power remained at 2 units each.\n\nComparing the two countries, Australia relied heavily on coal for electricity production in both years, while France shifted significantly towards nuclear power. Both countries saw an increase in total electricity production over the 20-year period.",
      "expectedOutput": "The pie charts compare the amount of electricity produced using five different sources of fuel in two countries over two separate years.\n\nTotal electricity production increased dramatically from 1980 to 2000 in both Australia and France. While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\nCoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country\u2019s electricity.\n\nAustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source in France, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.",

It was exhibited in 1908 under the title Liebespaar (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The painting depicts a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful robes decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nThe painting now hangs in the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered a masterpiece of Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and Klimt's most popular work after Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.

Digital buoys, deployed in the ocean, collect data on sea conditions, and synoptic charts provide a comprehensive overview of atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nIn the second stage, the collected data is analyzed and used to create forecasts. Satellite photos and radar screens are analyzed to identify weather systems and predict their movement. Synoptic charts are used to understand the broader weather patterns and to make long-term forecasts.\n\nIn the final stage, the forecast is prepared for broadcast.

Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers.

His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is known as \"Brown Spot,\" which is a common fungal infection that affects a wide range of plants, including many types of trees, shrubs, and vegetables. Brown Spot is characterized by the presence of brown or tan spots on the leaves, which can vary in size and shape. These spots often have a darker border and can cause the leaves to become discolored, wilted, or even fall off.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Spot\nBrown Spot is caused by various fungi, including Alternaria, Cercospora, and Septoria species. These fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions and can spread quickly through water droplets, wind, or contact with infected plants. The disease can weaken plants, reduce their growth, and affect their overall health.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Spot\n1. **Remove Infected Leaves**: Prune and dispose of any infected leaves to prevent the spread of the fungus. Do not compost infected plant material, as the fungus can survive in the compost.\n\n2. **Improve Air Circulation**: Ensure that there is good air circulation around the plants. This can be achieved by spacing plants appropriately and trimming dense foliage.\n\n3. **Avoid Overwatering**: Water plants in the morning to allow the leaves to dry before nightfall. Avoid overhead watering, as it can spread the fungus.\n\n4. **Use Fungicides**: Apply a fungicide labeled for Brown Spot control. Copper-based fungicides, mancozeb, and chlorothalonil are commonly used. Follow the instructions on the label carefully.\n\n5. **Plant Resistant Varieties**: If possible, choose plant varieties that are resistant to Brown Spot.\n\n6. **Clean Tools and Equipment**: Sanitize pruning tools and other gardening equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\n7. **Practice Crop Rotation**: If the disease affects vegetables, practice crop rotation to avoid planting susceptible crops in the same location for several years.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Brown Spot, helping to keep your plants healthy and thriving.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is early blight. Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.\n\nEarly blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85\u02daF.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.\n\nTreatment\nPrune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.\nMake sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\nKeep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.\nDrip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.\nFor best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.\nContaining copper and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\nSERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.\nRemove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.\nBurn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",

      "actualOutput": "The image shows a close-up of a tree with resin or sap oozing out. This is a common symptom of a condition known as \"canker disease\" or \"bacterial canker.\" Canker disease is a serious issue that affects various types of trees and can lead to the death of branches or even the entire tree.\n\n### Introduction to Canker Disease:\nCanker disease is caused by various fungi and bacteria that infect the bark and wood of trees. It typically starts as small lesions that enlarge and deepen, eventually girdling the branch or trunk and killing the affected part. The oozing sap or resin is a defense mechanism of the tree, trying to seal off the infected area.\n\n### Treatment of Canker Disease:\n1. **Pruning and Removal:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected branches or limbs to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Prune back to healthy wood, ensuring clean cuts to promote healing.\n\n2. **Sanitation:**\n   - Clean pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution between cuts to prevent the spread of infection.\n   - Remove and dispose of infected plant material to reduce the risk of re-infection.\n\n3. **Preventative Measures:**\n   - Maintain good tree health by providing adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight.\n   - Avoid wounding the tree, as wounds can provide entry points for pathogens.\n\n4. **Chemical Treatments:**\n   - In some cases, fungicides or bactericides can be applied to infected areas to control the spread of the disease.\n   - Consult with a professional arborist or horticulturist for specific recommendations based on the type of tree and the severity of the infection.\n\n5. **Monitoring:**\n   - Regularly inspect trees for signs of canker disease, such as oozing sap, sunken areas on the bark, or dieback of branches.\n   - Early detection and treatment are crucial for effective management of the disease.\n\n### Prevention:\n- Plant disease-resistant tree varieties when possible.\n- Avoid over-fertilizing, which can weaken trees and make them more susceptible to disease.\n- Ensure proper air circulation around trees to reduce humidity levels, which can promote fungal growth.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage and prevent canker disease in trees, ensuring their health and longevity.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.",

The number of emigrants also increased during this period, but at a slower rate, reaching a peak of around 420,000 in 2008. The net migration, which is the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants, fluctuated during this period, with a peak of around 220,000 in 2004 and a low of around 140,000 in 2001.\n\nOverall, the number of immigrants in the UK was consistently higher than the number of emigrants during this period, resulting in a positive net migration. The net migration was highest in 2004, when the number of immigrants was significantly higher than the number of emigrants. In contrast, the net migration was lowest in 2001, when the number of immigrants and emigrants was more balanced.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows that the UK experienced a steady increase in the number of immigrants and emigrants from 1999 to 2008, with a positive net migration throughout this period.

The figure for net migration was around 160,000, and it remained at a similar level until 2003. From 1999 to 2004, the immigration rate rose by nearly 150,000 people, but there was a much smaller rise in emigration. Net migration peaked at almost 250,000 people in 2004.\n\nAfter 2004, the rate of immigration remained high, but the number of people emigrating fluctuated. Emigration fell suddenly in 2007, before peaking at about 420,000 people in 2008. As a result, the net migration figure rose to around 240,000 in 2007, but fell back to around 160,000 in 2008.",

It is characterized by the formation of dark, sunken lesions on the canes and distorted, misshapen fruit. The disease is most common in wet, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through infected plant material.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected canes and fruit to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - Prune out any dead or diseased canes in the winter when the plant is dormant.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the plants.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application:**\n   - Apply fungicides such as copper-based products or mancozeb to control the disease.\n   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant blackberry varieties that are resistant to Blackberry Canker.\n\n5. **Clean Planting Material:**\n   - Use certified, disease-free planting material to avoid introducing the disease into your garden.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can effectively manage and control Blackberry Canker, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.",

It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad or neem oil, which are effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.\n   - Rotate crops to avoid reinfestation in the same area.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control leaf miner damage in your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.",

Clubroot causes the formation of galls or swellings on the roots and lower stems, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and eventually death of the plant.\n\n### Introduction to Clubroot\nClubroot is caused by a protist (a type of microorganism) that infects the roots of susceptible plants. The disease is prevalent in cool, wet soil conditions and can persist in the soil for many years.\n\n### Symptoms\n- Galls or swellings on roots and lower stems\n- Stunted growth\n- Yellowing and wilting of leaves\n- Poor yield\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Soil Management:**\n   - **pH Adjustment:** Clubroot thrives in acidic soil. Adjust the soil pH to 6.5-7.0 by adding lime.\n   - **Soil Solarization:** Use plastic sheeting to heat the soil, which can kill the clubroot spores.\n\n2. **Crop Rotation:**\n   - Rotate crops to avoid planting cruciferous plants in the same soil for at least 7-8 years.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant varieties that are resistant to clubroot.\n\n4. **Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\n5. **Biocontrol:**\n   - Use biocontrol agents like Bacillus subtilis, which can help suppress the disease.\n\n6. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Fungicides like metalaxyl or fosetyl-aluminum can be used as a preventive measure, but they are not effective once the disease has established.\n\n### Conclusion\nClubroot is a challenging disease to manage, but a combination of soil management, crop rotation, and the use of resistant varieties can help control its spread and reduce its impact on cruciferous crops.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.",

The theme is often said to celebrate the festive spirit and worldly commotion at the Qingming Festival, rather than the holiday's ceremonial aspects, such as tomb sweeping and prayers. Read right to left, as a viewer unrolled it, successive scenes reveal the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as economic activities in rural areas and the city, and offer glimpses of period clothing and architecture. The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all Chinese paintings, and it has been called \"China's Mona Lisa.\"",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is apple scab, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab is a common and destructive disease that affects apples and pears, causing brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit. It can significantly reduce the quality and yield of the crop.\n\n### Introduction to Apple Scab:\n- **Symptoms**: Brown or black spots on leaves, stems, and fruit.\n- **Impact**: Reduces fruit quality and yield.\n- **Favorable Conditions**: Moist and cool weather.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention:\n1. **Cultural Practices**:\n   - **Pruning**: Remove infected branches and leaves to reduce the spread of the fungus.\n   - **Sanitation**: Clean up and dispose of fallen leaves and fruit to reduce overwintering sites for the fungus.\n   - **Planting Distance**: Ensure proper spacing between trees to improve air circulation.\n\n2. **Chemical Control**:\n   - **Fungicides**: Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or copper-based products. Timing is crucial, typically starting at petal fall and continuing at regular intervals.\n   - **Bordeaux Mixture**: A mixture of copper sulfate and lime can be effective.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties**:\n   - Plant apple varieties that are resistant to apple scab.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Monitor the orchard regularly to detect early signs of infection.\n   - Use weather-based models to predict the risk of infection and time fungicide applications accordingly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nApple scab is a serious disease that requires a combination of cultural practices, chemical control, and the use of resistant varieties to manage effectively. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are key to controlling the disease and protecting the crop.",
      "expectedOutput": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.",

It is characterized by the formation of dark, sunken lesions on the canes and distorted, misshapen fruit. The disease is most common in wet, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through infected plant material.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected canes and fruit to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - Prune out any dead or diseased canes in the winter when the plant is dormant.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the plants.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application:**\n   - Apply fungicides such as copper-based products or mancozeb to control the disease.\n   - Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant blackberry varieties that are resistant to Blackberry Canker.\n\n5. **Clean Planting Material:**\n   - Use certified, disease-free planting material to avoid introducing the disease into your garden.\n\nBy combining these practices, you can effectively manage and control Blackberry Canker, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is crown gall, a common plant disease caused by the soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

Clubroot causes the formation of galls or swellings on the roots and lower stems, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and eventually death of the plant.\n\n### Introduction to Clubroot\nClubroot is caused by a protist (a type of microorganism) that infects the roots of susceptible plants. The disease is particularly problematic in cool, wet conditions and can persist in the soil for many years.\n\n### Symptoms\n- Galls or swellings on roots and lower stems\n- Stunted growth\n- Yellowing and wilting of leaves\n- Poor yield\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Soil Management:**\n   - **Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting cruciferous plants in the same soil for at least 7-8 years.\n   - **Soil pH:** Maintain soil pH between 6.5 and 7.0, as clubroot thrives in acidic soils.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - **Clean Tools:** Disinfect tools and equipment before use to prevent spreading the disease.\n   - **Clean Seeds:** Use certified, disease-free seeds.\n\n3. **Chemical Control:**\n   - **Fungicides:** Apply fungicides specifically labeled for clubroot control, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n4. **Biological Control:**\n   - **Beneficial Microbes:** Use beneficial microbes that can suppress clubroot, such as certain strains of Bacillus and Trichoderma.\n\n5. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - **Plant Resistant Varieties:** Choose plant varieties that are resistant to clubroot.\n\n### Conclusion\nClubroot is a challenging disease to manage, but a combination of soil management, cultural practices, and chemical or biological controls can help mitigate its impact. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to effective management.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is likely **leaf miner damage**. Leaf miners are small insects that lay eggs on the surface of leaves. The larvae then burrow into the leaf tissue, creating tunnels and feeding on the leaf's mesophyll layer, which results in the characteristic holes and discolored patches seen in the image.\n\n### Introduction to Leaf Miner Damage:\n- **Cause:** Leaf miners, which are small insects like flies or moths.\n- **Symptoms:** Holes, tunnels, and discolored patches on leaves.\n- **Impact:** Can weaken plants and reduce their overall health and productivity.\n\n### Treatment Options:\n1. **Physical Removal:**\n   - Remove and destroy affected leaves to prevent the spread of the larvae.\n\n2. **Biological Control:**\n   - Introduce natural predators of leaf miners, such as parasitic wasps, which lay their eggs inside leaf miner larvae.\n\n3. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply insecticides specifically formulated for leaf miners. Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad or neem oil, which are effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.\n   - Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of leaf miner populations in the soil.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to physically prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control leaf miner damage in your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.",

This disease affects blackberry plants, causing distorted and discolored growths on the fruit and cankers on the stems and branches.\n\n### Introduction:\nBlackberry Canker is a serious disease that can significantly reduce the yield and quality of blackberry crops. It is characterized by the formation of dark, sunken lesions on the stems and cankers that girdle the branches, leading to dieback. The fruit may also become distorted and discolored, as seen in the image.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected plant parts to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - Prune back to healthy tissue, ensuring that all infected parts are removed.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the plants.\n\n3. **Fungicide Applications:**\n   - Apply fungicides such as copper-based fungicides or mancozeb to control the disease.\n   - Follow the recommended application rates and timings as per the fungicide label.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant blackberry varieties that are resistant to Blackberry Canker.\n\n5. **Clean Planting Material:**\n   - Use disease-free planting material to avoid introducing the fungus into the garden.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can effectively manage and control Blackberry Canker, ensuring healthier plants and better yields.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is crown gall, a common plant disease caused by the soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad or neem oil, which are effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Maintain good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of infected plant material.\n   - Rotate crops to prevent the buildup of leaf miner populations in the soil.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to physically prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control leaf miner damage in your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.",

By 1883, the village had grown slightly, with a few more buildings and the addition of the railway line. The railway station, which was built in 1909, became a significant hub for the village.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1922, the village continued to expand, with more buildings being constructed and the road network becoming more extensive. The motorway, which was built in 1970, also became a significant feature of the village, providing better connectivity to other areas.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1970, the village continued to grow, with the addition of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which became a popular recreational area. The road network expanded further, and the village became more developed.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1994, the village continued to grow, with more buildings being constructed and the road network becoming even more extensive. The village became more developed, with more amenities and services being provided for the growing population.\n\nOverall, the map shows how Chorleywood has developed from a small village to a more developed and connected community over the years.

Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",

      "expectedOutput": "It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.",

His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine. Pasteur's works are credited with saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

By 1980, the number of marriages had increased to around 2.5 million, while the number of divorces had also increased to about 1.5 million. In 1990, the number of marriages remained at around 2.5 million, but the number of divorces had decreased to around 1 million. Finally, in 2000, the number of marriages had decreased to around 2 million, while the number of divorces had increased to around 1.5 million.\n\nThe second chart shows that in 1970, around 70% of adult Americans were married, while around 20% were never married, 5% were widowed, and 5% were divorced. In 2000, the percentage of married adults had decreased to around 60%, while the percentage of never married adults had increased to around 30%.

On the left, two figures, often identified as Zephyrus and Chloris, blow a gentle breeze to carry Venus to the shore. On the right, Flora, the goddess of flowers, is depicted scattering flowers. The painting is renowned for its use of linear perspective, delicate colors, and the graceful, flowing lines of the figures. It is one of the most famous works of the Italian Renaissance.",
      "expectedOutput": "The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.",

The artwork depicts the goddess Venus emerging from the sea, standing on a giant scallop shell. The scene is set against a backdrop of a calm sea and a lush forest. The painting is known for its use of vibrant colors, detailed figures, and the graceful, flowing lines of the figures, which are characteristic of Botticelli's style. It is one of the most famous works of the Italian Renaissance and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.",
      "expectedOutput": "The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.",

This disease affects blackberry plants, causing distorted and discolored growths on the fruit and cankers on the stems and canes.\n\n### Introduction:\nBlackberry Canker is a serious disease that can significantly reduce the yield and quality of blackberry crops. It is characterized by the formation of dark, sunken lesions on the canes and distorted, misshapen fruit. The disease is most common in wet, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through infected plant material.\n\n### Treatment:\n1. **Pruning and Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected canes and fruit to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Prune out and dispose of any diseased or dead canes at the end of the growing season.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the plants by spacing them appropriately.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the plants.\n\n3. **Fungicide Application:**\n   - Apply fungicides labeled for blackberry canker control, such as copper-based fungicides or products containing thiophanate-methyl.\n   - Follow the recommended application rates and timings, typically starting at bloom and repeating every 7-10 days.\n\n4. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant blackberry varieties that are resistant or tolerant to blackberry canker.\n\n5. **Soil Health:**\n   - Maintain good soil health by using organic matter and ensuring proper nutrient levels.\n\nBy combining these practices, you can effectively manage and control blackberry canker, reducing its impact on your blackberry plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is crown gall, a common plant disease caused by the soil-borne bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. It is found throughout the world and occurs on woody shrubs and herbaceous plants including grapes, raspberries, blackberries and roses.\n\nCrown gall symptoms include round, wart-like growths \u2014 2 inches or larger in diameter \u2014 that appear at or just above the soil line, or on lower branches and stems. Plants with several galls may be unable to move water and nutrients up the trunk and become weakened, stunted and unproductive. Young plants can be killed by developing gall tissue.\n\nThe bacteria responsible for crown gall can persist in the soil for many years and are released when galls become saturated with moisture or as older galls decompose. Susceptible plants are infected through fresh wounds or abrasions, many of which are a result of pruning, freeze injury, soil insects, cultivation and other factors that may damage plants. Nursery stock is often infected through grafting and budding scars.\n\nTreatment\n1. Select resistant cultivars when possible and purchase plants from a reputable nursery.\n2. Do not buy plants that shows signs of swelling or galling.\n3. When caring for susceptible plants, avoid injury or pruning wounds that may come in contact with the soil.\n4. Use Tree Wrap to protect against string trimmer damage and keep your garden tools clean.\n5. Provide winter protection with natural burlap so bark does not crack.\n6. In many cases, existing galls can be removed with a sharp pruning knife. Destroy the infected plant tissue and treat the wound with pruning sealer. If the plant does not recover, remove and destroy it.",

Do not overmix.\n   - Divide the dough into two discs, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Prepare the Filling:**\n   - In a large bowl, mix together the sliced strawberries, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and almond extract.\n\n3. **Assemble the Pie:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n   - Roll out one disc of dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Transfer it to the dish and trim the edges, leaving about 1/2 inch overhang.\n   - Pour the strawberry mixture into the pie crust.\n   - Roll out the second disc of dough and cut it into strips to create a lattice top. Lay the strips over the filling, weaving them over and under each other.\n   - Trim the edges of the strips and fold the overhanging crust over the strips to seal. Crimp the edges for a decorative finish.\n\n4. **Bake the Pie:**\n   - Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips.\n   - Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and bake for an additional 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.\n   - If the crust starts to brown too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil.\n\n5. **Cool and Serve:**\n   - Allow the pie to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade strawberry pie with a lattice crust!",

It was exhibited in 1908 under the title Liebespaar (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The painting depicts a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful robes decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nThe painting now hangs in the \u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered a masterpiece of Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and Klimt's most popular work after Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.

Finally, in 2000, the number of marriages had decreased to around 2 million, while the number of divorces had increased to about 1.5 million.\n\nThe second chart shows that in 1970, the majority of adult Americans were married, with around 70% of adults being in this category. In 2000, the percentage of married adults had decreased to around 50%. The percentage of never-married adults had increased from around 10% in 1970 to around 20% in 2000.

The artwork depicts the goddess Venus emerging from the sea, standing on a giant scallop shell. The scene is set against a backdrop of a calm sea and a lush forest. The painting is known for its use of vibrant colors, detailed figures, and the graceful, flowing lines of the figures, which are characteristic of Botticelli's style. It is one of the most famous works of the Italian Renaissance and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.",
      "expectedOutput": "The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.",

The larvae then burrow into the leaf tissue, creating tunnels and feeding on the leaf's mesophyll layer, which results in the characteristic holes and discolored patches seen in the image.\n\n### Introduction to Leaf Miner Damage:\n- **Cause:** Leaf miners, which can be flies, moths, or beetles.\n- **Symptoms:** Small, irregular holes or tunnels in the leaves, often with a discolored or brownish appearance.\n- **Impact:** Can weaken the plant by reducing its ability to photosynthesize, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.\n\n### Treatment Options:\n1. **Physical Removal:**\n   - Remove and destroy affected leaves to prevent the spread of the larvae.\n\n2. **Biological Control:**\n   - Introduce natural predators of leaf miners, such as parasitic wasps or predatory mites, which can help control the population.\n\n3. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply insecticides specifically formulated for leaf miners. Look for products containing ingredients like spinosad, which is effective against leaf miner larvae.\n\n4. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Practice good garden hygiene by removing and disposing of plant debris where leaf miners might lay eggs.\n   - Rotate crops to avoid planting susceptible plants in the same location year after year.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Use row covers or fine mesh netting to physically prevent adult leaf miners from laying eggs on the plants.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage leaf miner damage and protect your plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "Anthracnose. It is caused by fungi in the genus Colletotrichum, a common group of plant pathogens that are responsible for diseases on many plant species. Infected plants develop dark, water soaked lesions on stems, leaves or fruit. The centers of these lesions often become covered with pink, gelatinous masses of spores especially during moist, warm weather. Anthracnose can reduce a beautiful harvest into rotted waste in just a few days.\n\nThe fungal disease overwinters in and on seeds, soil and garden debris. Cool wet weather promotes its development, and the optimum temperature for continued growth of the spores is between 75-85\u02daF. Moisture is required for development and germination of the fungus as well as for infection of the plant. It is spread by wind, rain, insects and garden tools.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant plant varieties when possible and use western grown seeds which have not been exposed to the disease.\n2. If this fungal problem is common, do NOT save your own seed from plantings.\n3. To avoid spreading the disease, keep out of gardens when plants are wet and make sure to disinfect all garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n4. Do not compost infected leaves, fruit or stems and thoroughly clean up garden areas in the fall, after harvest, to reduce over wintering sites for the fungal spores.\n5. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n6. Liquid copper sprays and sulfur powders should be applied weekly, starting when foliage begins to develop in the early spring and continuing throughout the growing season. Spray early in the day, and avoid applications during hot weather. Seeds may also be treated prior to planting.\n7. Neem oil spray is an organic, multi-purpose fungicide/insecticide/miticide that kills eggs, larvae and adult stages of insects as well as prevents fungal attack on plants. Apply early, at the first sign of spring budding, every 7-14 days as a preventative measure or on a 7-day schedule until existing problems are eliminated.",

It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease results in the formation of galls or swellings on the roots and lower stems of the plant, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and eventually death.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- Galls or swellings on the roots and lower stems.\n- Yellowing and wilting of the leaves.\n- Stunted growth and poor development of the plant.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention:\n1. **Soil Management:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n   - Practice crop rotation to avoid planting cruciferous crops in the same soil for at least 7-8 years.\n   - Improve soil drainage to reduce the risk of infection.\n\n2. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply fungicides specifically designed for clubroot control, such as metalaxyl or fosetyl-aluminum, following the manufacturer's instructions.\n   - Use soil fumigants like methyl bromide or chloropicrin to sterilize the soil before planting.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant varieties that are resistant to clubroot. Many modern cabbage and other cruciferous varieties have been bred for resistance to this disease.\n\n4. **Soil pH Adjustment:**\n   - Maintain a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.0, as clubroot is less severe in alkaline soils.\n\n5. **Clean Tools and Equipment:**\n   - Clean and disinfect all gardening tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and prevent clubroot in your cruciferous crops.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.",

Italy and Germany spent less, with Italy at approximately 150 thousand pounds and Germany at around 140 thousand pounds.\n\nIn the case of CDs, Britain and France spent the most, with Britain at around 165 thousand pounds and France at about 160 thousand pounds.

By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under \u00a3150,000) for each of the six products. \n\nThe figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly \u00a3160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes.

Brown Rot is caused by the fungus Monilinia fructicola and is characterized by the appearance of brown, rotting spots on the fruit, which can eventually spread to the entire fruit and cause it to fall off the tree.\n\n### Introduction to Brown Rot\nBrown Rot is a serious disease that can significantly reduce fruit yields and quality. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through the tree, affecting both the fruit and the branches. The fungus overwinters in mummified fruit on the ground and in infected twigs, and it spreads through wind, rain, and insects.\n\n### Symptoms of Brown Rot\n- Brown, rotting spots on the fruit.\n- Fruit may fall prematurely.\n- Infected branches may show brown, canker-like lesions.\n\n### Treatment and Prevention of Brown Rot\n1. **Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy all mummified fruit from the ground and tree.\n   - Prune and dispose of infected branches.\n\n2. **Cultural Practices:**\n   - Ensure good air circulation around the tree by pruning.\n   - Avoid overhead watering to reduce humidity around the tree.\n\n3. **Chemical Control:**\n   - Apply fungicides such as captan, chlorothalonil, or copper-based fungicides.\n   - Timing is crucial; apply fungicides before and after bloom, and after rain events.\n\n4. **Biological Control:**\n   - Use biofungicides containing Bacillus subtilis or other beneficial bacteria to suppress the fungus.\n\n5. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant disease-resistant varieties when available.\n\n### Conclusion\nBrown Rot is a serious disease that requires a combination of sanitation, cultural practices, and chemical or biological control to manage effectively. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are key to preventing significant damage to fruit trees.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is Brown rot (Monilinia fructicola), the most common fungal disease affecting the blossoms and fruit of almonds, apricots, cherries, peaches and plums. It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.",

Satellite images provide a broad view of weather patterns, while radar screens offer more detailed information about precipitation and wind. Digital buoys, deployed in the ocean, collect data on sea conditions, and synoptic charts provide a comprehensive overview of atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nIn the second stage, Analysis & Forecasting, the collected data is analyzed to create satellite photos and radar screens. These visual representations help meteorologists understand current weather conditions and predict future trends.\n\nIn the final stage, Preparing the Broadcast, the analyzed data is used to prepare weather forecasts for dissemination. These forecasts are then broadcast through various media, including television, radio, and recorded announcements, ensuring that the public receives up-to-date and reliable weather information.\n\nOverall, the diagram demonstrates a systematic and comprehensive approach to weather forecasting, utilizing a range of data sources and analysis techniques to provide accurate and timely information to the public.",

Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.",

Italy and Germany spent less, with Italy at approximately 150 thousand pounds and Germany at around 140 thousand pounds.\n\nIn the case of CDs, Britain and France spent the most, with Britain at around 165 thousand pounds and France at about 160 thousand pounds. Italy and Germany spent less, with Italy at approximately 150 thousand pounds and Germany at around 140 thousand pounds.\n\nRegarding perfumes, Britain and France spent the most, with Britain at around 160 thousand pounds and France at about 155 thousand pounds.

By contrast, Germans were the lowest overall spenders, with roughly the same figures (just under \u00a3150,000) for each of the six products. \n\nThe figures for spending on toys were the same in both France and Italy, at nearly \u00a3160,000. However, while French people spent more than Italians on photographic film and CDs, Italians paid out more for personal stereos, tennis racquets and perfumes. The amount spent by French people on tennis racquets, around \u00a3145,000, is the lowest figure shown on the chart.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is called \"Blossom End Rot\" (BER). It is a common disorder that affects tomatoes, peppers, and other vegetables. Blossom End Rot is characterized by the appearance of a dark, sunken, and often leathery area on the bottom of the fruit, opposite the stem end. This condition is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant, which can occur due to irregular water supply, high temperatures, or other environmental factors.\n\n### How to Treat Blossom End Rot:\n\n1. **Improve Watering Practices:**\n   - Ensure consistent and adequate watering to maintain soil moisture. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - Use a mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Apply Calcium Fertilizer:**\n   - Apply a calcium-rich fertilizer to the soil. Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) can also be used, as it contains magnesium, which helps in the absorption of calcium.\n   - Foliar sprays of calcium chloride can be applied directly to the leaves to help the plant absorb calcium more efficiently.\n\n3. **Adjust Soil pH:**\n   - Maintain a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8, as this range is optimal for calcium absorption.\n   - Test the soil pH and adjust it if necessary using lime or sulfur.\n\n4. **Improve Soil Structure:**\n   - Add organic matter such as compost to the soil to improve its structure and water-holding capacity.\n   - Ensure good soil aeration to promote root growth and nutrient uptake.\n\n5. **Monitor and Adjust Fertilization:**\n   - Avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, as high nitrogen levels can interfere with calcium uptake.\n   - Use a balanced fertilizer that is low in nitrogen and high in potassium and phosphorus.\n\n6. **Prune Excess Foliage:**\n   - Remove excess foliage to improve air circulation and reduce the risk of disease.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can help prevent and manage Blossom End Rot in your tomato plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.\n   - **Timing**: Apply fungicides before and during the flowering period, and continue applications at regular intervals throughout the growing season.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties**:\n   - Plant apple varieties that are resistant to Apple Scab.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Monitor the orchard regularly for early signs of infection.\n   - Use weather-based models to predict the risk of infection and time fungicide applications accordingly.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you can effectively manage and control Apple Scab in your apple trees.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is Brown rot (Monilinia fructicola), the most common fungal disease affecting the blossoms and fruit of almonds, apricots, cherries, peaches and plums. It overwinters in mummified fruit (on the tree and on the ground) and infected twigs.\n\nThe disease first infects blossoms in spring and grows back into the small branches to cause cankers that can kill stems. Large numbers of flower-bearing stems are killed when the disease is severe. Dead flowers often remain attached into the summer. Developing or mature fruits show circular or brown spots that spread rapidly over the surface and light gray masses of spores are produced on the rotted areas. Rotted tissue remains relatively firm and dry.\n\nBrown rot spores are carried by wind, rain and insects to the open or unopened blossoms and young shoots. If water is present \u2014 either from rain, dew or watering \u2014 on the flower surface the spores can germinate and penetrate the plant. Disease development takes place over a wide temperature range and flowers can be infected from the time buds open until petals fall. Under favorable conditions, brown rot spreads quickly and an entire crop can be completely destroyed on the tree.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prompt removal and destruction of infected plant parts helps breaks the life cycle of the disease in individual trees and small orchards, and may be sufficient to keep brown rot below damaging levels.\n3. It is important to rake up and remove any fallen fruit or debris from under trees.\n4. Prune trees occasionally to improve air circulation. Also, water from below to keep from wetting blossoms, foliage and fruit.\n5. Use Tanglefoot\u00ae Pruning Sealer to seal all cuts and wounds and protect against insects and disease organisms.\n6. Ready to use copper fungicides or sulfur powders should be applied weekly to infected trees starting when the blossoms are just beginning to open and continuing throughout the growing season. If at all possible, time applications so that 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n7. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a foliar spray (1 tsp/ gallon of water) to combat this destructive stone fruit problem.\n8. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.",

The railway line was constructed in 1909, and this led to further development, with more buildings being constructed around the railway station.\n\nIn 1922, the village continued to expand, with new buildings being constructed in the areas around the railway station and along the main roads. The motorway, which was built in 1970, also contributed to the village's growth, with new buildings being constructed along the motorway and in the surrounding areas.\n\nBy 1994, Chorleywood had become a much larger village, with a significant increase in the number of buildings and a more extensive road network. The village had expanded in all directions, with new buildings being constructed in the areas around the railway station, along the main roads, and along the motorway.\n\nOverall, the map shows how Chorleywood has developed from a small village into a much larger and more extensive settlement, with the railway and motorway playing a significant role in the village's growth.",

Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",

Blossom End Rot is characterized by the appearance of a dark, sunken, and often leathery area on the bottom of the fruit, opposite the stem end. This condition is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant, which can occur due to irregular water supply, high soil salinity, or rapid growth.\n\n### How to Treat Blossom End Rot:\n\n1. **Improve Watering Practices:**\n   - Ensure consistent and adequate watering to maintain soil moisture. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - Use a mulch to help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Apply Calcium:**\n   - Apply a foliar spray of calcium chloride or calcium nitrate to the affected plants. This can help increase calcium uptake by the plant.\n   - Ensure that the soil pH is between 6.0 and 6.8, as this range is optimal for calcium availability.\n\n3. **Manage Soil Salinity:**\n   - Avoid over-fertilizing with high-nitrogen fertilizers, as this can increase soil salinity and reduce calcium uptake.\n   - Use organic fertilizers and compost to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.\n\n4. **Monitor Plant Growth:**\n   - Ensure that the plants are not growing too rapidly, as this can exacerbate the problem. Prune excess foliage if necessary to slow down growth.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures:**\n   - Rotate crops to avoid planting the same type of vegetable in the same spot every year.\n   - Use disease-resistant varieties when possible.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can help prevent and manage Blossom End Rot in your tomato plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

Clubroot causes the formation of galls or swellings on the roots and lower stems, leading to stunted growth, wilting, and eventually death of the plant.\n\n### Introduction to Clubroot\nClubroot is caused by a protist (a type of microorganism) that infects the roots of susceptible plants. The disease is particularly problematic in cool, wet conditions and can persist in the soil for many years.\n\n### Symptoms\n- Galls or swellings on roots and lower stems\n- Stunted growth\n- Yellowing and wilting of leaves\n- Poor yield\n\n### Treatment and Prevention\n1. **Soil Management:**\n   - **pH Adjustment:** Clubroot thrives in acidic soil. Adjust the soil pH to 6.5-7.0 by adding lime.\n   - **Crop Rotation:** Rotate crops to avoid planting cruciferous plants in the same soil for at least 7-8 years.\n\n2. **Resistant Varieties:**\n   - Plant varieties that are resistant to clubroot.\n\n3. **Sanitation:**\n   - Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Clean and disinfect gardening tools and equipment.\n\n4. **Fungicides:**\n   - Use fungicides specifically labeled for clubroot control, such as fosetyl-aluminum.\n\n5. **Biological Control:**\n   - Some beneficial fungi and bacteria can help suppress clubroot.\n\n### Long-Term Management\n- **Soil Solarization:** Cover the soil with plastic to heat it, which can kill the clubroot spores.\n- **Cover Crops:** Use cover crops like mustard, which can help suppress clubroot.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and prevent clubroot in your cruciferous crops.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is club root. Affecting most brassica crops (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.), club root is a serious plant disease in North American home gardens. It is caused by the soil-borne fungus Plasmodiophora brassicae which infects susceptible plants through root hairs. Diseased roots become swollen, misshapen and deformed (clubbed) often cracking and rotting. As a result, plants have difficulty absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nPlants often grow poorly and wilt during the heat of the day; plants often revive during cool nights. Outer leaves may turn yellow, purple or brown. Club root will reduce yields and can cause total crop failure.\n\nFungal spores can be spread by wind, water and garden tools. Disease development can occur over a wide range of conditions, but is favored by excessive moisture, low soil pH and soil temperatures between 64 and 77\u02daF. Spores can survive in the soil for as many as 10 years.\n\nTreatment\n1. Fungicides will NOT treat this soil-dwelling micro-organism.\n2. Choose resistant cultivars when possible.\n3. Try to prevent the occurrence of this disease by keeping a clean garden and rotating crops.\n4. Keep in mind that the disease spores can persist in the soil for up to 20 years. If club root is present you may want to solarize the soil.*\n5. Control susceptible weeds \u2014 mustard, radish, shepherd\u2019s purse \u2014 that may be infected to reduce potential buildup of the disease.\n6. Carefully remove infected plants and sterilize garden tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after use.\n7. Raise your soil\u2019s pH to a more alkaline 7.2 by mixing oyster shell or dolomite lime into your garden in the fall. Simple and affordable soil test kits are available to check pH often.",

The main roads were already in place, and the railway line, which was built in 1909, was not yet present. By 1883, the village had grown slightly, with a few more buildings and the addition of the railway line. The railway station, which was built in 1909, became a significant hub for the village.\n\nFrom 1883 to 1922, the village continued to expand, with more buildings being constructed and the road network becoming more extensive. The motorway, which was built in 1970, also became a significant feature of the village, providing better connectivity to other areas.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1970, the village continued to grow, with the addition of Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which became a popular recreational area. The road network expanded further, and the village became more developed.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1994, the village continued to grow, with more buildings being constructed and the road network becoming even more extensive. The village became more developed, with the addition of more amenities and facilities.\n\nOverall, the map shows how Chorleywood has developed from a small village to a more developed and connected community over the years. The addition of the railway line, motorway, and Chorleywood Park and Golf Course have all contributed to the village's growth and development.",

Four periods of development are shown on the map, and each of the populated areas is near to the main roads, the railway or the motorway.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood covered a small area next to one of the main roads. Chorleywood Park and Golf Course is now located next to this original village area. The village grew along the main road to the south between 1883 and 1922, and in 1909 a railway line was built crossing this area from west to east. Chorleywood station is in this part of the village.\n\nThe expansion of Chorleywood continued to the east and west alongside the railway line until 1970. At that time, a motorway was built to the east of the village, and from 1970 to 1994, further development of the village took place around motorway intersections with the railway and one of the main roads.",

Satellite images provide a broad view of weather patterns, while radar screens offer more detailed information about precipitation and wind. Digital buoys, deployed in the ocean, collect data on sea conditions, and synoptic charts provide a comprehensive overview of atmospheric pressure and temperature.\n\nIn the second stage, Analysis & Forecasting, the collected data is analyzed to create satellite photos, radar screens, and synoptic charts. These visual representations help meteorologists understand current weather conditions and predict future trends.\n\nIn the final stage, Preparing the Broadcast, the analyzed data is used to prepare weather forecasts for dissemination. These forecasts are then broadcast through various media, including television, radio, and recorded announcements, ensuring that the public receives up-to-date and reliable weather information.\n\nOverall, the diagram demonstrates a systematic and comprehensive approach to weather forecasting, utilizing a range of data sources and analysis tools to provide accurate and timely information to the public.",
      "expectedOutput": "The figure illustrates the process used by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.\n\nThere are four stages in the process, beginning with the collection of information about the weather. This information is then analysed, prepared for presentation, and finally broadcast to the public.\n\nLooking at the first and second stages of the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analysing it. Firstly, incoming information can be received by satellite and presented for analysis as a satellite photo. The same data can also be passed to a radar station and presented on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Secondly, incoming information may be collected directly by radar and analysed on a radar screen or synoptic chart. Finally, drifting buoys also receive data which can be shown on a synoptic chart.\n\nAt the third stage of the process, the weather broadcast is prepared on computers. Finally, it is delivered to the public on television, on the radio, or as a recorded telephone announcement.",

The artwork depicts the goddess Venus emerging from the sea, standing on a large scallop shell. The scene is set against a backdrop of a calm sea and a lush forest. On the left, two figures, often identified as Zephyrus and Chloris, are depicted blowing a gentle breeze to carry Venus to shore. On the right, a woman, possibly Flora, is seen draping a cloth around Venus. The painting is renowned for its use of linear perspective, delicate brushwork, and the graceful, flowing lines of the figures. It is one of the most famous works of the Italian Renaissance.",
      "expectedOutput": "The Birth of Venus is a painting by the Italian artist Sandro Botticelli, probably executed in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is better known than the Primavera. As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.",

Follow label instructions for application timing and frequency.\n   - **Timing**: Apply fungicides before and after bloom, and continue at regular intervals throughout the growing season.\n\n3. **Resistant Varieties**:\n   - Plant apple varieties that are resistant to apple scab.\n\n4. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**:\n   - Monitor trees regularly for early signs of infection.\n   - Use a combination of cultural, chemical, and biological control methods.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and control apple scab, ensuring healthier trees and better apple yields.",
      "expectedOutput": "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.\n\nOn apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely.\n\nTreatment\n1. Choose resistant cultivars when available.\n2. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.\n3. Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.\n4. Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.\n5. On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.\n6. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n7. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide\u00ae Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.\n8. Contact your local Agricultural Extension office for other possible solutions in your area.",

      "actualOutput": "The graph illustrates the global water usage by sector from 1900 to 2000, while the table provides data on water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in the year 2000.\n\nFrom the graph, it is evident that agriculture is the largest consumer of water, with its usage increasing significantly over the century. In 1900, agricultural water use was around 500 km\u00b3, which rose to approximately 2,500 km\u00b3 by 2000. Industrial water use also saw a substantial increase, starting at around 100 km\u00b3 in 1900 and reaching about 1,000 km\u00b3 in 2000. Domestic water use, while the smallest sector, also showed a steady increase from around 50 km\u00b3 in 1900 to about 500 km\u00b3 in 2000.\n\nThe table compares water consumption in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000. Brazil, with a population of 176 million, had 26,500 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 359 m\u00b3. In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.2 million, had only 100 km\u00b2 of irrigated land and a water consumption per person of 8 m\u00b3. This indicates that Brazil, despite having a much larger population, consumes significantly more water per person compared to the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows a clear trend of increasing water use across all sectors, with agriculture being the most significant consumer. The table highlights the disparity in water consumption between Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with Brazil consuming much more water per person.",
      "expectedOutput": "The charts compare the amount of water used for agriculture, industry and homes around the world, and water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt is clear that global water needs rose significantly between 1900 and 2000, and that agriculture accounted for the largest proportion of water used. We can also see that water consumption was considerably higher in Brazil than in the Congo.\n\nIn 1900, around 500km\u00b3 of water was used by the agriculture sector worldwide. The figures for industrial and domestic water consumption stood at around one fifth of that amount. By 2000, global water use for agriculture had increased to around 3000km\u00b3, industrial water use had risen to just under half that amount, and domestic consumption had reached approximately 500km\u00b3.\n\nIn the year 2000, the populations of Brazil and the Congo were 176 million and 5.2 million respectively. Water consumption per person in Brazil, at 359m\u00b3, was much higher than that in the Congo, at only 8m\u00b3, and this could be explained by the fact that Brazil had 265 times more irrigated land.",

It can be shared among colleagues or classmates to lighten the mood and create a shared understanding of the challenges of staying awake and alert.\n\n    Procrastination humor: The meme can also be used to depict the internal struggle between wanting to sleep or rest instead of engaging in productive activities. It can be shared when discussing procrastination or humorous self-reflections on the constant desire to avoid responsibilities and indulge in relaxation.\n\n    Comedic irony: The meme's contradiction between sleep time and wanting to sleep at other times can be used as a form of comedic irony in various contexts. It can be shared when discussing situations where our desires or behaviors contradict what is expected or appropriate, adding a humorous twist to the conversation.\n\nUltimately, the meme can be employed in different situations where its theme of sleepiness, conflicting desires, or ironic situations aligns with the topic or sentiment being discussed, adding a touch of humor and relatability to the conversation or online interaction.",

      "actualOutput": "The disease shown in the image is called \"Blossom End Rot\" (BER). It is a common disorder that affects tomatoes, peppers, and other vegetables. Blossom End Rot is characterized by the appearance of a dark, sunken, and often leathery area on the bottom of the fruit, opposite the stem end. This condition is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant, which can occur due to irregular water supply, high temperatures, or other environmental factors.\n\n### How to Treat Blossom End Rot:\n\n1. **Improve Watering Practices:**\n   - Ensure consistent and adequate watering to maintain soil moisture. Avoid letting the soil dry out completely.\n   - Use a mulch around the base of the plants to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.\n\n2. **Apply Calcium Fertilizer:**\n   - Apply a calcium-rich fertilizer to the soil. Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) can also be used, as it contains magnesium, which helps in the absorption of calcium.\n\n3. **Adjust Soil pH:**\n   - Maintain a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8, as this range is optimal for calcium absorption.\n\n4. **Monitor Soil Moisture:**\n   - Use a soil moisture meter to monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering accordingly.\n\n5. **Avoid Over-Fertilizing:**\n   - Excessive nitrogen can lead to rapid growth, which can exacerbate Blossom End Rot. Use balanced fertilizers and avoid over-fertilizing.\n\n6. **Prune Lower Leaves:**\n   - Prune the lower leaves of the plant to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the fruit.\n\n7. **Use Organic Matter:**\n   - Incorporate organic matter like compost into the soil to improve its structure and water-holding capacity.\n\nBy implementing these practices, you can help prevent and manage Blossom End Rot in your tomato plants.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is blossom end rot. A serious disorder of tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant, blossom end rot is an environmental problem (not fungal) most often caused by uneven watering or by calcium deficiency. (These can be related; uneven watering can interfere with the uptake of calcium.) This common garden \u201cdisease\u201d is often brought on by rapid growth from too much fertilizer, high salt levels or drought.\n\nBlossom end rot symptoms occur on both green and ripe fruits and is identified by water-soaked areas that gradually widen and mature into sunken, brown, leathery spots on the bottom end. In many cases, secondary pathogens, which appear as a black, fuzzy-like growth, attack the affected area and cause complete rotting of the fruit. Blossom end rot will not spread from plant to plant.\n\nTreatment\nSince this plant problem is physiological in nature, fungicides will not work as a control measure. We recommend the following:\n\n1. Choose resistant vegetable varieties whenever possible.\n2. Prevent problems by keeping soil evenly moist and by foliar spraying plants with a kelp or calcium solution.\n3. Adding high levels of calcium \u2014 bone meal, oyster shell or gypsum \u2014 to the soil at planting time usually prevents this problem from developing.\n4. A layer of mulch (straw, compost, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August.\n5. Foliar applications of Liquid Calcium 5% (1-2 Tbsp/ gallon of water) can be used to correct or prevent deficiencies of this essential nutrient. For best results, combine with a natural surfactant to increase adhesion and spray leaves to the point of run-off.\n6. Mulching plants will help conserve moisture and provide a more uniform water supply.\n7. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizers which accelerate vegetative growth and reduce the uptake of calcium by plants. A large selection of balanced organic fertilizers are available at Planet Natural.",

The painting depicts a couple, believed to be Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife, in a domestic setting, with various symbolic elements that suggest themes of marriage, fertility, and domestic life. The reflection in the mirror in the background is a notable feature, showing the artist and the back of the couple, adding depth and complexity to the scene.",

It forms a full-length double portrait, believed to depict the Italian merchant Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, presumably in their residence at the Flemish city of Bruges.\n\nIt is considered one of the most original and complex paintings in Western art, because of its beauty, complex iconography, geometric orthogonal perspective, and expansion of the picture space with the use of a mirror. According to Ernst Gombrich \"in its own way it was as new and revolutionary as Donatello's or Masaccio's work in Italy. A simple corner of the real world had suddenly been fixed on to a panel as if by magic... For the first time in history the artist became the perfect eye-witness in the truest sense of the term\". The portrait has been considered by Erwin Panofsky and some other art historians as a unique form of marriage contract, recorded as a painting. Signed and dated by van Eyck in 1434, it is, with the Ghent Altarpiece by the same artist and his brother Hubert, the oldest very famous panel painting to have been executed in oils rather than in tempera. The painting was bought by the National Gallery in London in 1842.",

      "actualOutput": "The image shows a close-up of a tree with resin or sap oozing out. This is a common symptom of a condition known as \"canker disease\" or \"bacterial canker.\" Canker disease is a serious issue that affects various types of trees and can lead to the death of branches or even the entire tree.\n\n### Introduction to Canker Disease:\nCanker disease is caused by various fungi and bacteria that infect the bark and wood of trees. It typically starts as small lesions that grow and spread, eventually girdling the tree and causing branch dieback or even the death of the tree. The oozing sap or resin is a defense mechanism of the tree, trying to seal off the infected area.\n\n### Treatment of Canker Disease:\n1. **Pruning and Removal:**\n   - Remove infected branches and limbs as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Prune back to healthy wood, ensuring clean cuts to promote healing.\n\n2. **Sanitation:**\n   - Clean pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution between cuts to prevent the spread of the disease.\n   - Remove and dispose of infected plant material to reduce the risk of re-infection.\n\n3. **Preventative Measures:**\n   - Maintain good tree health by providing adequate water, nutrients, and sunlight.\n   - Avoid wounding the tree, as wounds can provide entry points for pathogens.\n\n4. **Chemical Treatments:**\n   - In some cases, fungicides or bactericides can be applied to infected areas to control the spread of the disease.\n   - Consult with a professional arborist or horticulturist to determine the appropriate chemical treatment for your specific situation.\n\n5. **Monitoring:**\n   - Regularly inspect trees for signs of canker disease, such as oozing sap, lesions, or branch dieback.\n   - Early detection and treatment are crucial for effective management of the disease.\n\n### Prevention:\n- Plant disease-resistant tree species when possible.\n- Avoid overwatering, as excess moisture can promote fungal growth.\n- Ensure proper air circulation around trees to reduce humidity levels.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help manage and prevent canker disease in trees, ensuring their health and longevity.",
      "expectedOutput": "It is bacterial canker, most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.\n\nNote: If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.\n\nThe bacterium that causes canker, Pseudomonas syringae, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.\n\nTreatment\n1. Prune flowering trees during blooming when wounds heal fastest.\n2. Remove wilted or dead limbs well below infected areas.\n3. Avoid pruning in early spring and fall when bacteria are most active.\n4. Treat all pruning cuts immediately with Tanglefoot\u00ae Tree Pruning Sealer and make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment \u2014 one part bleach to 4 parts water \u2014 after each cut.\n5. If using string trimmers around the base of trees avoid damaging bark with breathable Tree Wrap to prevent infection.\n6. Brush bark with white latex paint diluted with water to reduce bark-damaging temperature fluctuations.\n7. Research has shown that copper fungicides have some success against this stone fruit problem. However, results are inconsistent. We recommend using it as one part of a total management program.\n8. Remove weeds and grass from around the base of young trees to improve air circulation and keep the trunk and crown dry.\n9. Organocide\u00ae Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Mix 1/3 to 3/4 oz per gallon of water and paint or spray over pruning wounds and surrounding areas.",

By 2000, the total production had increased to 170 units, with coal still being the dominant source, producing 130 units. Natural gas and oil each contributed 2 units, while hydro power remained at 10 units, and nuclear power was introduced, contributing 36 units.\n\nIn France, in 1980, nuclear power was the main source of electricity, producing 25 units out of a total of 90 units. Coal and hydro power each contributed 25 units, while natural gas and oil produced 20 and 5 units, respectively. By 2000, the total production had increased to 180 units, with nuclear power becoming the dominant source, producing 126 units. Coal and hydro power each contributed 25 units, while natural gas and oil produced 2 units each.\n\nComparing the two countries, Australia relied heavily on coal for electricity production in both years, while France shifted from a diverse mix of sources to a heavy reliance on nuclear power.

While the totals for both countries were similar, there were big differences in the fuel sources used.\n\nCoal was used to produce 50 of the total 100 units of electricity in Australia in 1980, rising to 130 out of 170 units in 2000. By contrast, nuclear power became the most important fuel source in France in 2000, producing almost 75% of the country\u2019s electricity.\n\nAustralia depended on hydro power for just under 25% of its electricity in both years, but the amount of electricity produced using this type of power fell from 5 to only 2 units in France. Oil, on the other hand, remained a relatively important fuel source in France, but its use declined in Australia. Both countries relied on natural gas for electricity production significantly more in 1980 than in 2000.",
